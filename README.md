# Reading Notes v2

This is a fresh start of the reading-notes project. The full v1 remains on the branch `archive/v1` (tag: `v1-final`).

## Getting started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The reader UI is restored; `public/docs` is empty apart from `index.json` (so no entries). Add new markdown files under `public/docs/<Letter>/your-file.md` and rerun the dev server to see them.
