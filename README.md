## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating a new note

1. Make sure `refs/library.bib` is up to date (exported via Better BibTeX from Zotero).  
2. Run the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/newnote.sh <citekey|doi|url> [--build]
```

Examples:

```bash
# Using a Zotero citekey
./scripts/newnote.sh Valtonen2020ApproachingChangeDesign --build

# Using a DOI
./scripts/newnote.sh 10.1016/j.sheji.2020.08.004 --build
```

- This creates a new Markdown file in the correct A‚ÄìZ folder under `public/docs/`.  
- The `--build` flag will automatically refresh `public/docs/index.json`.  
- Each note includes a **structured template** for Purpose, Methodology, Findings, etc.  
- You can then edit the Markdown directly to add your notes.
