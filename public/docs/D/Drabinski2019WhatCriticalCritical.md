# Scope of this note
This note covers the full article. It treats the piece as a programmatic statement on critical librarianship, with particular attention to classification, infrastructures, labour and power. It anchors Strand 3.2 (“Classification as ethics/politics”) and links directly to the project’s analysis of absence-producing systems.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Drabinski asks what is “critical” about critical librarianship and how such a stance reorients everyday library work. She argues that library work *structures intellectual worlds*, that this work is *not neutral*, and that critical librarianship provides a framework for interrogating how library structures came to be and how they might be changed (p. 49).

The aim is to:
- Demonstrate how classification and infrastructural practices reproduce power relations.
- Articulate principles for a critical librarianship grounded in social justice.
- Encourage librarians to act as agents capable of making “new and better worlds” (p. 49).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

This is an **analytic essay**, not an empirical study. The method consists of:
- Autobiographical reflection on professional experience (e.g. queer identity vs HQ classification) (p. 50–51).
- Critical reading of infrastructures: classification schemes, vendor systems, ALA guidelines (pp. 51–53).
- Political framing influenced by feminist, queer and critical pedagogy traditions (pp. 50–51).

The stance is **critical, interpretive and praxis-oriented**.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Knowledge organisation is a technology of power.**  
   Classification structures reflect dominant worldviews. Filipino materials become “excess” under LC in the Philippines; queer lives are pathologised in HQ (pp. 50–51). Classification produces both *order and excess* [p. 50].

2. **Critical librarianship interrogates structures, not just radical outcomes.**  
   The task is to analyse “how [systems] perpetuate ideologies and…how to interrupt and change the stories they tell” (p. 51). Classification cannot be abolished, but it can be made visible and contestable.

3. **Four principles define critical librarianship.**  
   - Interrogate power in structures and systems (p. 51).  
   - Acknowledge political/economic context (security, assessment, value metrics) [p. 52].  
   - Surface hidden labour (p. 52).  
   - Articulate how infrastructures enable or foreclose inquiry [pp. 52–53].

4. **Critical librarianship rests on the belief that the world could be otherwise.**  
   Nothing about library structures is inevitable; they can be changed in everyday practice (p. 53).

5. **Whiteness, labour and collective resistance are central.**  
   The profession is “notoriously white, 88% at last count” [p. 55]. Critical librarianship must address whiteness, microaggressions and labour precarity [pp. 55–56]. Union organising becomes a site of critical practice [p. 57].

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

- Frames classification as *ethics and politics*, not only technical structure-making.
- Shows how infrastructures produce *absences* and *peripheries*, aligning with strands on silence and missingness.
- Provides an interpretive lens for understanding how design decisions become sedimented into institutional practice.
- Introduces a praxis model that connects worldview shifts to micro-level interventions.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Conceptual vocabulary for classification as power.**  
  LC’s treatment of Filipino materials as “excess” directly exemplifies how classification produces marginality [p. 50].

- **Examples of absence-through-classification.**  
  Queer materials placed under pathologising headings produce structural invisibility and silence [pp. 50–51].

- **Infrastructural critique.**  
  The overview of vendor systems, standards and metadata bottlenecks explains practical pathways through which missing or misclassified data are produced [pp. 52–53].

- **Labour as epistemic infrastructure.**  
  Making hidden labour visible strengthens the project’s argument that missingness is shaped by who does data work and under what conditions (pp. 52, 55–56).

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Clear line from theory to practice; examples keep the argument grounded (pp. 50–55).
- Positionality underpins the critique; whiteness and labour are named rather than implied (pp. 50–56).
- Pragmatic about action as well as diagnosis.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- Illustrative rather than empirical; evidence is anecdotal.
- Largely U.S.-centred; needs translation for other contexts.
- Light on computational and algorithmic systems.

### Author’s credibility
Drabinski is a leading critical-librarianship figure at the CUNY Graduate Center, widely cited on queer cataloguing and critical pedagogy (p. 57).

### Contextual validity
Core insights generalise across library and data infrastructures, though U.S.-centric references (ALA guidelines, hiring trends) limit direct lift-and-shift.

### Comparisons
- Aligns with feminist cataloguing critiques (Olson; Berman).  
- Complements Moss & Thomas on how classification produces absence.  
- Resonates with Gilliland & Caswell on imaginaries and user experience.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- The article frames classification as a primary site where ethical and political worlds are built.  
- It emphasises that missingness is structure-producing, not accidental.  
- Suggests adopting a “critical habit of mind” across design research—foregrounding power, labour and possibility.  
- Encourages small-scale interventions in infrastructure as seeds of structural change.

### Alternative explanations?
Resource scarcity may explain some failures (e.g. cataloguing backlogs), but Drabinski shows these are politically shaped by priorities, whiteness and institutional ideology.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?
- Practice: treat classification structures as revisable and teach them as political.  
- Policy: address whiteness and labour precarity structurally, not rhetorically.  
- Theory: classification systems should be read as epistemic infrastructures with historical sedimentation.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “Library work structures intellectual worlds as library workers collect, organize, make accessible, and preserve materials for use. This work is not neutral.” (p. 49)
- “Knowledge organization structures are also about power, the power to produce both order and excess.” (p. 50)
- **Paraphrase:** Under LC, Filipino materials become “special collections,” revealing how Western ontologies marginalise local knowledge (p. 50).
- **Paraphrase:** Queer identities, lived as fluid, are fixed into pathologised HQ categories, revealing heteronormative assumptions embedded in classification (pp. 50–51).
- “Critical librarianship challenges the assumptions of a universal patron or universal librarian…” (p. 52)
- “At the heart of critical librarianship…is a conviction and a radical hope that things could be different.” (p. 53)
- On whiteness: the profession is “notoriously white, 88% at last count.” (p. 55)
- “Organizing is the reference interview, over and over and over again.” (p. 57)

## Questions for further research
- How can critical librarianship be operationalised in computational schemas and ML pipelines?  
- What methods can capture experiences of misclassification or infrastructural harm?  
- How do global contexts reshape or challenge Drabinski’s assumptions?  
- What models of co-governance could reconfigure classification with communities?
