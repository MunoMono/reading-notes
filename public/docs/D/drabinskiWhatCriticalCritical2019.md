## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
To articulate what makes *critical librarianship* ‘critical’ and show how library work—classification, cataloguing, discovery, policies and teaching—materially structures knowledge and power; then to outline principles for changing those structures towards social justice.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.  
Conceptual and position piece (originated as a keynote). Uses reflective analysis and field examples (for example, Library of Congress (LC) classification in the Philippines; Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) treatment of gender and sexuality; classroom and HR anecdotes) to show how ideologies are embedded in library structures and practice. No formal empirical study.

## Key findings and arguments
- **Libraries are not neutral.** Library work ‘structures intellectual worlds’ and is produced within systems marked by racism, patriarchy and capitalism; neutrality claims obscure this.  
- **Libraries are structuring machines.** Knowledge organisation fixes materials in time and space; classification and discovery are *technologies of control* that collate like with like and encode ideology.  
- **Classification implies power.** Catalogues and classification schemes facilitate some ways of knowing while marginalising others (for example, LC classification abroad; Filipiniana set aside; queer topics ghettoised in HQ).  
- **Principles of critical librarianship.** (i) interrogate power in systems and standards, and ask who benefits; (ii) situate policies in social and political context; (iii) surface hidden and emotional labour; (iv) make infrastructures visible and expand what counts as collection and knowledge; (v) recognise the world could be otherwise and organise to change it.  
- **Organise power.** Move beyond critique to collective action (hiring and retention, policy change, labour organising) that materially shifts conditions.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
Provides a rigorous lens for the methods spine: treat descriptions, discovery tools and policies as designable power structures; evaluate neutrality claims; and prioritise interventions (classification audits, provenance notes, naming and identity policies) that reduce harm and expand representativeness before adding new technology.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Confirms that **knowledge-organisation choices are ideological**, not neutral—mandating audits of LC and LCSH mappings and local thesauri (for example, HQ shelving and queer subjects). ``[@drabinskiWhatCriticalCritical2019]``  
- Justifies surfacing **invisible labour** (cataloguing, vocabulary maintenance, identity fixes) as explicit work items and resources.  
- Grounds **policy design** (access, security, data retention, name changes) in the lived context of users rather than a ‘universal patron’ assumption.  

### Hooks into the project
- Workstreams: classification and vocabulary review; bias and provenance notes; identity and name-change policy; alternative and outsider collections; worker-facing workload and recognition review.  
- Decisions: what to collect (beyond major publishers), how to describe, and which platform defaults to resist or reshape.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Clear, grounded account of how cataloguing and classification enact power; vivid examples (Philippines and Filipiniana; queer-subject treatment); actionable principles.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- Largely US-centred and essayistic; lacks comparative metrics or formal evaluation of interventions; some recommendations assume governance latitude that may not exist.  

### Author’s credibility
- Senior librarian (CUNY) associated with #critlib and critical pedagogy; widely cited in knowledge-organisation debates.  

### Contextual validity
- Highly applicable to GLAM and academic libraries; localisation needed for non-LC contexts and different legal and cultural regimes.  

### Comparisons
- Resonates with infrastructure and standards critiques and more-than-human/justice turns; complements technical bias work by focusing on *institutional* structures and labour.  

## Interpretation
### Your own insights
- Treat description and classification change as **first-order design** (before tooling).  
- Build **participatory vocabularies** with communities; document compromises and gaps.  
- Make labour and policy trade-offs visible in outputs (provenance notes, ‘about the data’ pages) to normalise accountability.  

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- ‘**Library work structures intellectual worlds… This work is not neutral.**’ (page 49)  
- ‘**As the tools that order things, our catalogues and classification structures are themselves technologies of power**.’ (page 50)  
- ‘**Critical librarianship knows that the world could be different**.’ (page 53)  
- On hiring and race: a call to **normalise discussion of race** and address whiteness in libraries and retention. (pages 55–56)

## Questions for further research
- How to **measure** the impact of vocabulary and classification changes on discovery, use and user trust?  
- What governance models sustain **ongoing** critical description (time and labour budgeting, recognition)?  
- How do critical policies (identity and name-change, policing and security, access) alter **outcomes** for marginalised users over time?
