# Scope of this note
This note critically reviews Dorst’s paper by situating it against three persistent themes in the PhD project: (1) the DDR’s historical ambition to create a systematic science of design and its collapse in practice, (2) Cross’s framing of designerly ways of knowing as epistemically distinct, and (3) the project’s interpretivist–critical and taxonomic frameworks for reopening DDR classifications under contemporary complexity. Dorst’s notion of ‘academic design’ is read not as an endpoint but as a discursive gesture that requires operationalisation. The note embeds Dorst’s argument into the integrated research spine, emphasising how his claims must be translated into criteria, methods and artefacts if they are to advance beyond rhetoric.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Dorst addresses the enduring criticisms of design research: that it is disconnected from practice, scattered and incoherent, and overly analytical rather than generative. He asks how design research might mature into a hybrid field that integrates practice and theory without repeating the failed quest for a universal ‘science of design’. His answer is the proposal of ‘academic design’, a deliberately constructed field occupying the space between practice and research.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
The paper is discursive rather than empirical. Dorst draws analogies to marketing (case studies as intermediate artefacts), art theory (Krauss’s expanded field) and management (Mintzberg’s critique of backward-looking business research). He illustrates with examples such as empathic design and a social design intervention in Amsterdam’s Bijlmer district. No systematic sample or method is presented; evidence functions as rhetorical support for a manifesto-like proposal.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Bridging practice and research** requires intermediate artefacts, analogous to Harvard business cases: rigorous, richly contextualised accounts accessible to both practitioners and scholars.  
2. **Scatteredness of design** is not a weakness but an expanded field defined by tensions (autonomy vs service, pragmatism vs idealism, material vs immaterial). These contradictions generate dynamism rather than disorder.  
3. **Analytical paradigms are insufficient**: design must emulate medicine’s curative, forward-looking stance, creating new practices rather than only analysing existing ones.  
4. **‘Academic design’ as hybrid**: a nomadic, discursive space where practice and research co-produce new methods. Dorst highlights empathic design and frame creation as examples of hybrid knowledge production.  

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
- DDR’s ambition was precisely to unify design practice and research under systematic models. Dorst’s proposal recognises the same need but sidesteps DDR’s historical lessons, which the project explicitly reopens.  
- Cross sought epistemic distinctiveness (‘designerly ways of knowing’). Dorst instead imports analogies from marketing and medicine, risking dilution of designerly identity. This creates space for the project to define operational standards for hybrid artefacts grounded in DDR’s archival logics.  
- The project’s interpretivist–critical framework directly addresses Dorst’s lack of operationalisation: it specifies how to interrogate assumptions, power structures and classifications underpinning systematic methods.  

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Validates the project’s aim to produce intermediate artefacts (archival cases, cross-case matrices, AI-assisted simulations) as contributions to both practice and scholarship [@Dorst2016DesignPracticeDesign, pp. 2671–2672].  
- Affirms the need for forward-looking, R&D-style interventions that anticipate future design practices, resonating with the project’s practice-based and computational strands [@Dorst2016DesignPracticeDesign, p. 2673].  
- Offers a conceptual banner (‘academic design’) under which the project’s hybrid methodological contributions can be positioned, but demands the specification of criteria the paper leaves vague.  

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Archival reopening of DDR systematic models; action research cycles in contemporary projects; computational simulations as design R&D.  
- **Deliverables →** Critical taxonomy of DDR methods; casebook of intermediate design cases; prototype decision-support tool.  
- **Stakeholders →** Academic design researchers, innovation labs, policy-makers seeking actionable yet critically grounded frameworks.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Sharp synthesis of critiques into three clear problem areas: disconnection, scatteredness, and paradigm misfit.  
- Productive reframing of scatteredness as generative contradiction, echoing Cross’s refusal to reduce design to a single epistemic mode.  
- Future-oriented emphasis on design research as R&D for practice, which aligns with action-research traditions and with the project’s experimental strand.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Historical amnesia.** DDR already attempted the bridge Dorst proposes. Archer’s operational models were concrete designs for ‘academic design’ avant la lettre. Dorst mentions neither DDR nor Archer, losing the chance to learn from their failure under live conditions.  
- **Analogy over identity.** Borrowing from marketing and medicine sidesteps the challenge of articulating criteria for designerly knowledge itself. Cross’s distinctiveness is dissolved into eclectic comparison.  
- **Vague standards.** Dorst does not specify what counts as a rigorous intermediate case, or how hybrid experiments should be evaluated. Without criteria, ‘academic design’ risks becoming another rhetorical black box.  
- **Avoidance of taxonomic critique.** DDR’s classificatory logics (fixed briefs, staged processes, quantitative vs qualitative splits) structured the very incoherence Dorst diagnoses. His paper misses the need to reopen these taxonomies, which this project addresses directly.  

### Author’s credibility
Dorst is professor of Design Innovation (UTS, TU Eindhoven) with a strong track record in frame creation and design theory. His reputation lends weight, but the paper reads more as programmatic positioning than methodological development.

### Contextual validity
The argument generalises well to design research discourse, but its effectiveness depends on institutions building infrastructures for intermediate artefacts. DDR’s experience shows this is not trivial: funding bodies, councils and archives shape what survives as ‘knowledge’. Dorst underplays such institutional conditions.

### Comparisons
- **Archer (1968, DDR).** Sought closure via systematic models; collapsed under evolving briefs and incomplete data. Dorst gestures toward hybridity but fails to extract operational lessons from this breakdown.  
- **Cross (1982, 1990).** Emphasised epistemic distinctiveness. Dorst leans on external analogies, diluting the specificity Cross defended.  
- **DDR as institution.** Functioned as a ‘centre of calculation’, accumulating inscriptions into systematic methods. Dorst echoes this ambition but neglects the taxonomic and classificatory operations that made DDR simultaneously productive and fragile.  

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Dorst’s proposal is best read as a provocation to develop operational criteria the paper leaves unarticulated. For the project, this means:  
1. **Intermediate case standards.** Each case must include full context, artefact evolution, decision events, frame shifts and contradictory evidence. Both inspiration and analytical traceability are required.  
2. **Hybrid experiment rubrics.** Action-research cycles must document hypotheses, interventions, inscriptions and outcomes, with evaluation criteria grounded in both design efficacy and knowledge transfer.  
3. **Taxonomic reopening.** DDR’s classificatory categories (brief as fixed, data as quantitative/qualitative split, staged models) must be re-examined as political artefacts rather than neutral descriptors. Dorst’s rhetoric does not address this.  
4. **Computational accompaniment.** Simulations must remain auditable, preventing ‘academic design’ from becoming a new black box.  

### Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- ‘Knowledge of design resides both in practice and in academic research – and the problem is that there is little common ground or communication between the two’ (p. 2671).  
- **Paraphrase:** Dorst argues that design research must shift from backward-looking analysis to forward-looking, curative experimentation, akin to medical R&D (pp. 2673–2674).  
- **Critical gloss:** This ambition mirrors Archer’s, but unlike Archer’s operational models, Dorst leaves methodological implementation entirely undefined.

## Questions for further research
- What evaluative standards distinguish intermediate cases from anecdotes?  
- How can Archer’s structural logics (constraints, feasibility domains) be reframed as heuristic probes for hybrid practice?  
- How do DDR’s taxonomic operations (fixed briefs, staged processes) shape the incoherence Dorst diagnoses, and how should they be redesigned?  
- Can computational tools make ‘academic design’ auditable and critically addressable, avoiding new black boxes?  
- How might institutional infrastructures (archives, councils, funders) sustain the hybrid artefacts Dorst envisions, given DDR’s historical struggles?
