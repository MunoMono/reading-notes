# Scope of this note
This note focuses on the *Introduction* and the opening theoretical chapter “Theorising the silences”, treating them as the book’s conceptual core. Empirical chapters (e.g. on Jamaica, Malawi, Turkey, “comfort women”) are used selectively as examples rather than exhaustively summarised. The emphasis is on how the volume theorises *absence*, *silence* and *missingness* as structural features of archives and, by extension, of data infrastructures.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

The book asks how archival silences are produced, where in the life-cycle of records they arise, and what political, ethical and epistemic consequences follow from missing, distorted or uncreated archives.

- Drawing on Trouillot, the editors frame silences as “inherent in the writing of history and in the creation of archives,” created at four moments: **fact creation**, **fact assembly**, **fact retrieval**, and **retrospective significance** (p. 2). The volume concentrates on the first two moments—making sources and assembling archives—because these are most directly shaped by record creators and archivists (p. 2).
- The stated aim is “to take, as far as practical, a global view of silences and absences and to extend the range of types of records under discussion” (p. 3). This is explicitly positioned against earlier, more nationally bounded work on archival silence.
- A secondary aim is to show that silences are not only the result of dramatic events (war, revolution, disaster) but are woven into mundane cataloguing practices, appraisal decisions, resource constraints and the politics of access.

So, at core, the book is about how **systems of recording and classification produce absence**, rather than absence being an accidental gap.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

This is an edited theoretical and interpretive volume rather than a single empirical study.

- **Design:** Conceptual framing by Moss and Thomas plus a series of case-based chapters. The introduction consolidates prior literature (Trouillot, Thomas/Johnson/Fowler, Gilliland & Caswell, Guberek & Hedstrom) and situates the volume within ongoing debates on archival power (pp. 2–3).
- **Geographical and institutional spread:** Chapters span Iceland, Australia, Brazil, Jamaica, Denmark, Britain, India, Malawi, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States (p. 3). This is used to support the claim that archival absences are pervasive, not local anomalies.
- **Methodological stance:** Critical-interpretive, drawing on archival theory, history, legal sources and political analysis. The book does not offer a formal comparative research design; instead, it treats diverse cases as *theoretical exemplars* of different modes of silence.
- **Temporal span:** Historical examples (colonial archives, wartime destruction, “comfort women” records) are read alongside contemporary digital issues (digitisation, differential access) to argue that new technologies reconfigure rather than erase silences (pp. 2, 11).

For the project, this reads as a **conceptual toolkit** rather than a methodological template, but it has strong implications for how studies of missing data should be designed.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Silences are structurally produced, not accidental.**  
   Trouillot’s four “moments” of silencing are invoked to insist that absences are baked into record-making and record-keeping, not merely the result of later loss (p. 2). The book focuses on how archives are *made*—through appraisal, cataloguing, destruction, transfer and access policies—rather than assuming a neutral accumulation of facts (p. 2).

2. **Silences arise from global power relations and colonial structures.**  
   The introduction shows how colonial and post-colonial regimes systematically shaped what was recorded and what was destroyed. British officials in Malawi burned “many sensitive local records” and shipped others back to Britain at independence: “You can have your country back, but not its records” (p. 4). In Jamaica, archival holdings overwhelmingly reflect plantation business and merchant profitability, such that “the voices of these exploited sectors, even though recorded and ‘written’ in records, are silenced by the oppression, purposes and prejudices of the recorder” (p. 4).

3. **Digitisation generates new silences and deepens existing ones.**  
   In “Theorising the silences”, the editors argue that digitisation introduces its own asymmetries:  
   > “Digitisation is silencing records because scholars at wealthy universities in the north have access to a diversity of material unavailable to scholars at poorer universities in the south.” (p. 11)  
   Digitisation programmes may privilege “canonical” and Western corpora, meaning that non-western, non-canonical and everyday records are excluded, “thus continuing to silence the poor and marginalised” (p. 11). Digital abundance co-exists with deepening inequalities of access and representation.

4. **Silence depends on *detection*; until then, it is ‘uncreated and potential’.**  
   A key conceptual move:  
   > “Silences only come into existence when researchers look for specific pieces of information in the archive. Until then, they are uncreated and potential rather than actual.” (p. 11)  
   This shifts silence from a purely objective property of a corpus to a *relational phenomenon* between an inquirer and a record system. Silence is a function of *questions asked* and *expectations of presence*.

5. **Silences ‘mean silences’: the loss of performative and contextual dimensions.**  
   The editors stress that archival practice has converted records “intended to be spoken out loud – to be performed – into texts to be read silently” and that this has “robbed them of much of their meaning” (p. 11). The point here is that silence is not only about missing entries, but also about the erosion of *modalities* (voice, gesture, performance) that cannot be fully textualised.

6. **Uncovering silence does not necessarily resolve injustice or deliver closure.**  
   The book cautions against a naïve politics of transparency. Drawing on Ketelaar and examples like Hillsborough, the editors argue that releasing previously hidden records may help some individuals but “the power of archives to prevent tragedies or to heal in highly conflicted situations is limited” (p. 12). Onora O’Neill’s intervention—“Do not imagine better record keeping will solve all this, it will not” (p. 12)—is used to puncture optimism that more complete records alone can fix structural harms.

7. **Silences can be intentional, protective or strategic, not only oppressive.**  
   While much of the volume deals with violent and coercive silencing, the theoretical chapter also hints that some forms of non-recording or non-disclosure can be tactics of protection or resistance (e.g. survivors’ reluctance to testify, communities controlling what is documented). Silence may be an assertion of agency rather than sheer lack.

Together, these arguments build a vocabulary in which *absence, silence and missingness* are socially produced, multi-layered and sometimes ambivalent.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

For the project’s framework on absence, silence and missing data, this volume is foundational:

- It reframes *missing data* as the outcome of decisions at the moments of **creation** and **assembly** of records (p. 2), which maps directly onto concerns about who gets counted, how and why.
- The idea that silences are “uncreated and potential” until research questions bring them into view (p. 11) aligns strongly with the project’s interest in *how questions and models make absences legible*.
- The emphasis on digitisation as a *new regime of silence* (p. 11) speaks directly to socio-technical infrastructures, platform datasets and computational archives.
- The colonial examples (Malawi, Jamaica) provide a template for reading contemporary civic and platform data as inheriting similar logics of exclusion and extraction (pp. 3–4).

In short, the book gives the project both **language** and **historical depth** for analysing why certain experiences and groups are structurally under-represented in data.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Conceptual backbone for “missingness”.** Trouillot’s four moments (p. 2) provide a clear analytical scaffold for mapping where missingness enters modern datasets: design of forms, institutional rules, storage, retrieval, interface.
- **Global, not parochial framing.** The aim “to take, as far as practical, a global view of silences and absences” (p. 3) supports the project’s claim that data gaps in, say, UK civic infrastructures resonate with worldwide patterns of archival inequality.
- **Digitisation and inequality.** The statement that digitisation “is silencing records because scholars at wealthy universities in the north have access” while others do not (p. 11) underpins arguments about platformised knowledge, paywalled datasets and uneven research capacity.
- **Uncreated archives and latent silences.** The formulation that silences are “uncreated and potential rather than actual” until sought (p. 11) is especially useful for thinking about *counterfactual* datasets—what is never logged, never scraped, never turned into a feature.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Powerful conceptual clarity.** The deployment of Trouillot’s four moments (p. 2) and the further refinement of concepts like “uncreated and potential” silences (p. 11) provide clear, portable ideas.
- **Global, comparative sensibility.** The editors explicitly expand beyond single-country treatments and assemble contributors from different “phonic communities” (p. 3), which supports the project’s interest in more-than-national infrastructures.
- **Attention to digital transformations.** The discussion of digitisation as a producer of new silences (p. 11) is especially relevant for computational historiography and data-driven design research.
- **Refusal of naïve transparency politics.** The point that “better record keeping will [not] solve all this” (p. 12) is an important counterweight to technocratic fantasies of data completeness.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Limited technical engagement.** While digitisation is problematised, there is little detailed analysis of contemporary data infrastructures, algorithms or standards. The argument largely stops at digitisation and differential access.
- **Case selection and imbalance.** Some cases are treated in depth (e.g. “comfort women,” Brazilian political police), while others are sketched. As an edited volume, coherence is uneven across chapters.
- **Methods for studying silence remain under-specified.** The book is rich on theory and examples but offers little concrete guidance on *methods* for empirically detecting and analysing silences in complex data systems.

### Author’s credibility
- Moss and Thomas are senior archival scholars and practitioners, with experience in UK national and academic archival institutions. Their prior work (*The Silence of the Archive*) is widely cited.
- The contributors include notable figures in archival theory and memory studies, lending weight to the volume’s claims.

### Contextual validity
- The core claims about how power, colonialism and institutional logics shape archives generalise well beyond the specific cases.
- The conceptual framework travels easily to digital and data-science contexts, even if these are not analysed in depth.
- Caution: some historical examples have highly specific legal and political backstories; they are best used as analogies rather than direct templates.

### Comparisons
- **With Trouillot:** The book operationalises Trouillot’s insights for archival practice by focusing on the first two moments (p. 2), turning a historiographical critique into an archival one.
- **With Thomas, Johnson & Fowler (*The Silence of the Archive*):** This volume broadens the geographical and thematic scope and adds more sustained attention to digitisation and global inequalities.
- **With Gilliland & Caswell, Guberek & Hedstrom:** Similar concern with filling gaps and confronting violence in the archive, but Moss & Thomas put more emphasis on the structural and institutional conditions that produce those gaps.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights

- The most important move for the project is the shift from treating “missing” as a *defect* of data to seeing it as an *effect* of design and power.  
- The phrase that silences are “uncreated and potential rather than actual” until a question makes them visible (p. 11) is particularly resonant for the design of research instruments and analytical models. Absence is not simply “there”; it is constructed in the encounter.
- The recognition that digitisation itself “is silencing records” (p. 11) reframes digital archives and datasets as *sites of active selection and exclusion*, not neutral mirrors of an underlying reality.
- Onora O’Neill’s warning that better record keeping “will not” solve all issues (p. 12) cautions the project against over-claiming for technical fixes (new schemas, better logging). Structural silences persist even under idealised data regimes.

### Alternative explanations?

- Some silences can be traced to material contingencies (war, flood, fire; p. 4) or resource constraints (staff shortages in Malawi, cataloguing backlogs in India; p. 3). These could be read as non-political.  
- However, the book insists that even these are shaped by unequal distributions of risk and investment. That is, *why* some archives burn and others are safeguarded, *why* some institutions endure chronic under-staffing, is itself political.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?

- **Practice:** Archivists and data custodians need to treat selection and description policies as sites of power, not neutral routines.  
- **Policy:** The global framing on records displacement (“You can have your country back, but not its records”; p. 4) speaks directly to contemporary debates on data sovereignty and repatriation of digital corpora.  
- **Theory:** The book reinforces an understanding of data and archives as *incomplete by design*, which supports the project’s argument that missingness is an epistemic condition to be theorised, not just a technical nuisance.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “Silences are created at four central moments: the moment of fact creation (the making of sources); the moment of fact assembly (the making of archives); the moment of fact retrieval (the making of narratives) and the moment of retrospective significance (the making of history in the final instance).” (p. 2)
- “This book focusses on the first two of Trouillot’s moments – the making of sources and the moment of fact assembly because these are the areas that are, on the whole, under the control of archivists and creators of records.” (p. 2)
- “The aim of this book is to take, as far as practical, a global view of silences and absences and to extend the range of types of records under discussion.” (p. 3)
- “You can have your country back, but not its records.” (p. 4)
- In Jamaica “all the records in the Archives relate to the business of plantation, the profitability of merchant houses, the management of asset – including human enslaved. Thus, the voices of these exploited sectors, even though recorded and ‘written’ in records, are silenced by the oppression, purposes and prejudices of the recorder.” (p. 4)
- “Digitisation is silencing records because scholars at wealthy universities in the north have access to a diversity of material unavailable to scholars at poorer universities in the south.” (p. 11)
- Digitisation programmes may exclude “non-western, non-canonical and non-quotidian” records, “thus continuing to silence the poor and marginalised.” (p. 11)
- “Silences only come into existence when researchers look for specific pieces of information in the archive. Until then, they are uncreated and potential rather than actual.” (p. 11)
- “Finally, we are increasingly aware that silences mean silences. That archival practices have turned records that were intended to be spoken out loud – to be performed – into texts to be read silently and by so doing have robbed them of much of their meaning.” (p. 11)
- Onora O’Neill: “Do not imagine better record keeping will solve all this, it will not.” (p. 12)
