# Scope of this note
This note focuses on Schwartz and Cook’s core thesis that archives and records are not neutral storehouses but socially constructed infrastructures of power that shape memory, identity, and historical knowledge. It concentrates on (i) how the authors dismantle archival myths of neutrality via postmodern and feminist critiques; (ii) their account of power operating through recordkeeping systems, appraisal, description, access and digitisation; and (iii) the implications for accountability and ethics in archival practice. It is read as a canonical bridge between classification politics (Bowker and Star) and the PhD’s concern with epistemic drift becoming materially stabilised and contested in institutional memory systems. (pp. 1–2, 5–6, 14–15)

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
The article functions as the guest editors’ introduction to two thematic issues on “archives, records, and power”. Its objective is to reframe archives and records as active sites where social power is negotiated, contested and confirmed, and to argue that archival work (recordkeeping design, appraisal/selection, description, preservation, and mediated access) exerts “enormous power over memory and identity”. The authors seek to denaturalise the profession’s self-myth of neutrality and to push for transparent debate and accountability regarding archival power. (pp. 1–2, 19)

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
This is a conceptual, synthetic position paper rather than an empirical study. Its method is:
- **Programmatic literature synthesis**: it triangulates archival theory with adjacent scholarship on memory, evidence, representation, museums, and postmodern/feminist critiques of objectivity (eg Halbwachs, Foucault, Derrida, Haraway). (pp. 3–4, 9–12)
- **Historical contextualisation**: it sketches how modern archives professionalised alongside “scientific history” and how archival “science” and neutrality claims became professionalised myths. (pp. 1, 9–11)
- **Analytic decomposition of archival practice**: it itemises where power enters archival workflows (system design, appraisal, description, preservation, access), and extends this to digital architectures (online selection, virtual exhibitions). (pp. 1–2, 14–15)
- **Illustrative exemplars** (secondary): it points to concrete historical cases (war records altered to protect reputations; apartheid archives; systemic exclusion of women; oral cultures vs European bureaucratic concepts) to demonstrate consequences. (pp. 4, 7, 16–17)

The “sample” is therefore discursive and documentary: selected literatures, examples, and debates rather than a defined dataset or participant cohort.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Archives are social constructs that embed and exercise power.** Archives originate in the information needs and social values of those who establish and maintain them; power operates through what is recorded, what is preserved, and how it is interpreted, making archives “critical” frameworks for collective memory and identity. (pp. 3–4, 13)
2. **Archivists are not neutral intermediaries; they are active mediators.** Through recordkeeping design, appraisal and selection, description, preservation, and patterns of access and use, archivists “reshape, reinterpret, and reinvent” the archive, influencing what is knowable and what becomes marginal. (pp. 1–2, 14)
3. **The neutrality myth is professionally convenient but epistemically dangerous.** Denial of archival power leaves creators, archivists and users “blind” to layers of intervention and meaning, sustaining a value-free illusion that privileges mainstream and powerful record creators. Recognising power enables questioning, accountability and more rigorous scholarship. (pp. 2, 6, 18)
4. **Digital media intensify archival power and ethical stakes.** Electronic records and online architectures can newly privilege certain actors and information types; at the same time, digitisation can democratise access while amplifying the archive’s traditional mediating power through descriptive practice, system architecture, and selective online exposure. (pp. 15, 18)

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
For a PhD examining epistemic drift across design methods, institutional archives, and computational reconstruction, Schwartz and Cook supply a foundational claim: drift is not merely conceptual change but is materially channelled by archival infrastructures that decide what survives, how it is ordered, and what becomes retrievable. Their insistence on “layers of meaning” added by creators, records managers, and archivists reframes archival materials as already-processed epistemic artefacts rather than raw evidence. (pp. 6, 18)

The article also provides a direct bridge to computational work: it warns that digitisation and system architecture are not neutral delivery mechanisms but new sites of selection and mediation. Any computational reconstruction of institutional memory (classification, retrieval, modelling) must therefore treat schemas and interfaces as power-laden, drift-producing instruments rather than transparent pipes. (pp. 15, 18)

## What the authors bring to the table
### Key contributions and claims
- **A canonical reframing of archives as power.** Archives and records “wield power” over accountability, scholarship, collective memory and identity; archivists wield power by actively shaping record lifecycles. (pp. 2, 13)
- **A workflow-level map of where power enters archival practice.** The paper specifies power points: recordkeeping system design; appraisal/selection; description; preservation; access mediation; and, in the digital realm, architecture and online selection. (pp. 1–2, 14–15)
- **A critique of positivist archival “science” and neutrality.** Postmodern destabilisation of truth and objectivity undermines professional neutrality myths; archives require “power-sensitive conversation” and ongoing critical interpretation among creators, keepers, and users. (pp. 9–12)
- **An identity-politics lens on appraisal and description.** Archivists are “major players” in identity construction by collecting “props” of identity and by validating narratives through documentary authority; the paper foregrounds gendered exclusion as a paradigmatic case. (pp. 16–17)

### How the PhD project responds to this evidence
- **Building on:** The project can treat archival description, metadata and selection as epistemic instruments that actively shape what later becomes computationally analysable. This supports a methodological move from “using archives” to “studying archives as infrastructures”. (pp. 14–15, 18)
- **Challenging:** The project can test how far “power” explanations risk flattening heterogeneous archival realities (including disorder, subversion, and emancipatory uses). The authors themselves caution against reducing archives to control alone; this tension becomes a productive analytic constraint. (pp. 14–15)
- **Informing practice:** The project can adopt the paper’s accountability stance by designing research instruments that make mediation legible (provenance of categories, documented selection criteria, interface decisions) rather than silently reproducing neutrality myths. (pp. 2, 19)

## Positioning this work
### What this literature will do for my project
- **Legitimise an infrastructural, political account of archival evidence.** It strengthens the thesis claim that institutional memory is actively made, not passively stored, and that archival infrastructures are ethical-political technologies. (pp. 1–2, 13)
- **Provide a mechanism for epistemic drift.** Appraisal, description, and access mediation systematically alter evidential landscapes; drift appears as an outcome of selections, naming practices and retrieval regimes. (pp. 14, 18)
- **Underwrite digital-method caution.** It supplies an explicit warning that digitisation expands both access and mediation power; this becomes a design brief for computational reconstruction that must remain reflexive about its own classificatory force. (pp. 15, 18)

### What this literature will not do
- **It will not supply an operational method for auditing power in specific archives.** It is programmatic and diagnostic; it motivates inquiry but leaves instrumentation (metrics, protocols, comparative designs) to later work. (pp. 19)
- **It will not resolve normative trade-offs.** The paper argues for multiplicity and transparency, but it does not fully settle how to balance privacy, access, representational justice, and feasibility in resource-constrained institutions. (pp. 2, 15)
- **It is not a case study of a single institution.** Its claims require local empirical corroboration where the thesis demands specificity (eg a particular archive’s appraisal regime or metadata schema). (pp. 4, 14)

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- **It names the archive as a power-laden memory technology.** The authors argue that archives are “active sites” where power is negotiated, and that archivists continually reshape the archive through design, selection and description—precisely the operations that create drift-prone traces. (pp. 1–2, 14)
- **It specifies where drift becomes material.** Power enters at appraisal/selection (“a tiny fraction” is kept), description (imposing emphases and viewing orders), and access (filters that shape perceptions). These are concrete loci for empirical study and computational modelling. (p. 14)
- **It anticipates the politics of digital reconstruction.** Through “descriptive practices and system architecture” and selection for online access, archives shape what is known about what has been preserved; this becomes a direct warning against treating digitised corpora as neutral ground truth. (p. 15)
- **It reframes archival neutrality as a research risk.** The neutrality myth supports documenting “mainstream culture” and official narratives and privileges textual evidence; this supports a thesis-level critique of dataset bias and modality bias. (p. 18)

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Workflow specificity rather than abstract critique.** The paper identifies concrete points of intervention (system design, appraisal, description, access, digital architecture), making “power” operationally discussable. (pp. 1–2, 14–15)
- **Balanced account of power and contingency.** It acknowledges chaos, eccentricity and subversion in recordkeeping and cautions against reducing archives to domination alone, while keeping the political stakes in view. (p. 14)
- **Strong cross-disciplinary synthesis.** It integrates memory studies and STS with archival practice, correcting the tendency of external “archive theory” to ignore real institutional work. (pp. 2, 4–6)
- **Direct relevance to digital infrastructures.** Its account of online mediation anticipates contemporary debates on platform power, metadata politics, and access governance. (p. 15)

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Programmatic breadth, limited empirical depth.** As an introduction, it establishes a position and literature map but provides few deep institutional analyses or methods for evidence collection and evaluation. (p. 1)
- **“Power” risks explanatory inflation.** The framing can over-attribute causality to archival intervention, underplaying how researchers, publics, and other institutions contest and rework archival meanings (although the authors partially offset this). (pp. 14–15)
- **Limited attention to implementation constraints.** The call for multiplicity and reflexivity is persuasive, but the paper leaves resourcing, governance and operational trade-offs (privacy, access, labour, digitisation costs) under-specified. (pp. 15, 19)

### Author’s credibility
Schwartz and Cook write from senior positions in archival institutions and scholarship and serve as guest editors of a dedicated thematic issue, signalling disciplinary authority and agenda-setting intent. The paper’s credibility rests less on original data than on informed synthesis and the ability to articulate a field-level problem: the profession’s neutrality myth and its consequences. (pp. 1–2)

### Contextual validity
The argument generalises strongly to bureaucratic and state-linked archival systems where appraisal, description, and access are formalised and consequential. Transfer to community archives, informal collections, or deliberately anti-institutional memory practices requires care, though the book’s emphasis on mediation remains relevant. The digital argument is historically situated (early-2000s web architectures), but its core mechanism—architecture and selection shaping knowledge—remains stable. (pp. 15, 18)

### Comparisons
- **With Bowker and Star:** Both treat classification/infrastructure as moral and political; Schwartz and Cook specify the archival workflow mechanisms (appraisal, description, access), supplying institutional levers that complement Bowker and Star’s broader infrastructure vocabulary. (pp. 14–15)
- **With Foucault/Derrida “the archive”:** The paper critiques metaphor-only “archive talk” that lacks understanding of real institutions, insisting on the profession’s theories and practices as the proper site of analysis. (pp. 2, 4)
- **With recordkeeping rationalisation traditions:** The text implicitly clashes with neutralist, positivist archival traditions (eg Jenkinson) by treating neutrality as myth-making that masks power. (pp. 11, 18)

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- **Archives as drift infrastructure:** The paper provides a strong theoretical basis for treating epistemic drift as infrastructure-mediated: what changes is not only interpretation but the evidential field itself (what is kept, named, ordered, and made retrievable). (p. 14)
- **Digital as amplification rather than rupture:** Digitisation increases access and publics’ power, yet simultaneously increases mediation via architecture and selection for online presence; drift risks shifting from boxes and finding aids to interfaces, metadata and search. (p. 15)
- **Neutrality as an epistemic hazard for computational work:** If neutrality myths conceal intervention, computational pipelines that treat digitised archives as ground truth reproduce the archive’s politics while claiming objectivity. The thesis can operationalise this as a requirement for “documented mediation” in dataset construction. (pp. 18–19)

### Critical thinking and rigour
The work deploys a post-positivist critical framework: social construction of institutions; power/knowledge analysis; situated knowledge and partial perspective; and attention to representation and mediation. Its rigour is strongest in identifying specific institutional practices and their consequences, and weaker in providing formal methods to measure or compare power effects across settings. It remains highly legible for thesis framing because it translates postmodern critique into practical archival operations. (pp. 9–12, 14–15)

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- 'Archives, then, are not passive storehouses … but active sites where social power is negotiated' (p. 1) (p. 1)  
- 'A classification is not of itself an explanation' is not in this paper; instead, Schwartz and Cook argue that power is “naturalized” and “rarely questioned” within archival frameworks. (p. 4) (p. 4)  
- **Paraphrase:** Archivists shape memory through system design, appraisal, description, preservation and access; denial of this power prevents accountability and misleads researchers. (pp. 1–2, 6) (pp. 1–2, 6)  
- **Paraphrase:** Digitisation both empowers public access and amplifies archival mediation through descriptive practice, architecture, and online selection, shaping what is known about what is preserved. (p. 15) (p. 15)

## Questions for further research
- How can archival mediation be operationalised for computational reconstruction (eg tracing appraisal decisions, descriptive schemas, access filters) without reproducing neutrality myths in code? (pp. 14–15, 18)
- What governance models make “power-sensitive conversation” practicable across creators, archivists, users and affected communities, especially under privacy and resource constraints? (pp. 12, 15)
- How do different archival architectures (finding aids, metadata standards, search interfaces, online exhibitions) differentially privilege narratives, and how can drift be measured across these layers? (p. 15)
- How should archives document and respect groups who do not wish to be “rescued” or named as marginalised, while still addressing systemic absence and bias? (pp. 17–18)
