# Scope of this note
This note covers the whole article, treated as a programmatic introduction to the “archives, records, and power” special issues of *Archival Science*. It is used as a foundational text for the project’s analysis of archives and classification as ethical–political infrastructures, and as a bridge into questions of absence, silence and missingness in modern memory.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Schwartz and Cook seek to reframe archives, records and archivists as **deeply implicated in power**, rather than neutral custodians of evidence.

They aim to:
- Expose the “myth of impartiality, neutrality, and objectivity” in archival practice (p. 1).
- Show how archives and records participate in the **construction of modern memory and identity**, rather than simply reflecting them (pp. 2–4, 16).
- Argue that acknowledging power in archival work is a precondition for accountability and for more equitable documentation (pp. 2, 5–6, 13–15).

In effect, the paper asks: **How do archives, records and archivists exercise power over what can be known, remembered and forgotten in modern societies?**

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

The article is a **conceptual and synthetic essay**, not an empirical study with a defined sample.

- It draws on **archival history and theory** (Jenkinson, Taylor, Bearman, Brothman, Brown, Ketelaar, Harris, Cook, Schwartz herself) to trace changing ideas about archives, evidence and professional neutrality (pp. 10–12, 17–18].
- It integrates **social theory and memory studies** (Halbwachs, Foucault, Derrida, Le Goff, Hutton, Geary) to situate archives inside a wider “power/knowledge nexus” (pp. 3–4, 6–8, 12).
- It uses **selective historical examples**:
  - Ancient and medieval archives and sacral uses of records (p. 7).
  - First World War record-shaping and later alteration (p. 7).
  - Systemic exclusion of women and other marginalised groups from archives (pp. 7, 16–17).
  - Apartheid and post-apartheid South African archives (pp. 4–5, 14–15).

Methodologically, it operates as **a theoretical framing essay** for the themed issues, synthesising existing scholarship and signalling directions for further research, rather than presenting new empirical data.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Archives are social constructs, not neutral storehouses.**  
   Archives arise from “the information needs and social values of the rulers, governments, businesses, associations, and individuals who establish and maintain them” (p. 3). They are “not passive storehouses of ‘old stuff’, but active sites where social power is negotiated, contested, confirmed” (p. 1).

2. **Archivists exercise power over memory and identity at multiple points.**  
   Archivists shape records **before**, **at** and **after** the point of archival accession:
   - in designing record-keeping systems,
   - in appraising and selecting a “tiny fragment” of records for preservation,
   - in description, preservation, and mediation of access (pp. 1–2, 13–14).  
   These decisions have “serious consequences for administrative accountability, citizen rights, collective memory, and historical knowledge” (p. 4).

3. **The myth of neutrality is itself a mechanism of power.**  
   Archivists’ “on-going denial” of their own power, combined with users’ assumptions that records are unproblematic, produces a “prescription for sterility” in the reference room (p. 2). The profession’s attachment to “archival science,” objectivity and original order is shown to be historically situated and open to critique (pp. 10–12, 18).

4. **Archives both reflect and constitute social memory and identity.**  
   Drawing on Halbwachs, Hutton and others, the authors argue that archives are part of the “social-intellectual frameworks” within which memory is possible (p. 3). They are “the basis for and validation of the stories we tell ourselves…that give cohesion and meaning to individuals, groups, and societies” (p. 13). This includes identity politics around nation, race, gender, class and locality (pp. 15–17).

5. **Power operates both through inclusion and exclusion.**  
   Records and archives “have the power to privilege and to marginalize…to be a tool of hegemony” or “a tool of resistance” (p. 13]. The paper emphasises:
   - Systematic historical exclusion of women and other subaltern groups (pp. 7, 16–17).
   - Decisions about which records and whose records are solicited, processed and promoted (p. 17).
   - The danger of documenting only “mainstream culture and powerful records creators” while neglecting others (pp. 17–18).

6. **Digital records intensify both risks and possibilities.**  
   Computer-generated records and networked access magnify archival power:
   - Without active intervention “only certain types of information, and thus only certain people and organizations in society, are going to be privileged in our social memory” (p. 15).
   - At the same time, digital technologies increase archives’ capacity to provide access and potentially democratise use, even as descriptive systems, system architecture and online selection introduce new filters (p. 15).

7. **To refuse to engage with power is to side with the status quo.**  
   The conclusion is explicit: “To choose not to engage in these debates is, in fact, a strong choice in favour of the status quo” (p. 19). Recognising power in archives is framed as an ethical obligation.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

For a project concerned with **classification as ethics/politics** and **absence/silence/missingness**, this article is foundational.

- It provides a **high-level power analysis** of archives and records, explaining why certain groups and practices are over-documented while others are absent or partial.
- It frames **archival decisions (appraisal, description, access)** as political, not merely technical, directly supporting the project’s argument that classification and data modelling are ethical acts.
- It shows how **professional myths of neutrality** themselves sustain silences, resonating with later work on archival silence and uncreated archives.
- It links archives to **identity formation and collective memory**, aligning with the project’s interest in whose experiences become countable, traceable and narratable in socio-technical systems.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Conceptual grounding for archives as power-laden infrastructures.**  
  The explicit claim that archives “are not passive storehouses of ‘old stuff’, but active sites where social power is negotiated, contested, confirmed” (p. 1) can anchor the project’s framing of archives and data infrastructures as sites of power rather than neutral containers.

- **Analytical lens on absence and missingness.**  
  The focus on **appraisal, selection, and differential documentation** (pp. 3–4, 13–17) provides a pathway to analyse structural patterns of missing data as outcomes of prior power-laden decisions.

- **Clarification of professional myths and their consequences.**  
  The critique of neutrality and “archival science” (pp. 10–12, 18) helps situate contemporary debates about bias, fairness and transparency in a longer history of professional self-understanding.

- **Bridge from analogue to digital.**  
  The discussion of electronic records and online access (p. 15) connects earlier archival concerns to contemporary issues in computational archives, platforms and AI systems.

### Hooks into the project

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Clear, programmatic argument that shows archives are power-laden and sets out the main themes (pp. 1–9, 13–18).
- Connects archival debates to memory studies, feminist theory and critiques of science (pp. 3–4, 6–8, 10–12).
- Names the neutrality myth and its risks without caricature (pp. 10–12).
- Flags how women and other groups were sidelined (pp. 7, 16–17), anticipating later justice work.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- Synthetic rather than empirical; examples are sketched, not unpacked (pp. 7, 16–17).
- Largely Western in focus; only glances at non-Western or oral contexts (p. 7).
- Offers a strong “why” but little step-by-step guidance for changing practice.

### Author’s credibility
- Schwartz and Cook are major figures in archival theory; Cook is linked to post-custodial and postmodern turns, Schwartz to critical work on photography and representation. Their Canadian institutional roles lend the argument weight (pp. 1, 10, 17–18).

### Contextual validity
- Arguments about power, memory and identity remain pertinent; digitisation, platforms and AI have amplified them.
- Some institutional specifics are time- and place-bound, but the conceptual frame travels to current digital and civic data contexts.

### Comparisons
- With Moss & Thomas: provides the power-and-memory frame for their account of how silences form during fact creation and assembly.
- With Gilliland & Caswell: focuses on structural power and practice, while they add affective and imaginative dimensions of living with absence.
- With Drabinski: her treatment of classification, labour and whiteness applies the claim that information institutions shape memory and identity (pp. 13–17).

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights

For the project, this article functions as **a conceptual hinge**:

- It shifts the analysis from “archives as sources” to **archives as agents** in the production of knowledge and memory.
- It justifies treating **appraisal, description and access** as key sites where absence and missingness are produced and contested.
- It frames archivists (and by extension, data professionals) as **powerful mediators**, whose decisions demand ethical and political scrutiny rather than being taken as neutral.

The emphasis on **postmodern critiques of truth and science** (pp. 10–12) supports a move away from seeing “complete data” as achievable or unproblematic. Instead, it encourages the project to treat missing data as a signal of deeper structural conditions.

### Alternative explanations?
- Resource constraints or technology could explain some patterns (documentation of elites, textual bias), but the article argues these limits are themselves socially structured (p. 15).

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?
- **Practice:** Archivists and data stewards are invited to surface and interrogate the power relations in their own decision-making, with particular attention to who is documented, how and for whose future use.
- **Policy:** The argument supports policy frameworks that centre accountability, diversity and rights in archival and data governance.
- **Theory:** The paper provides a vocabulary—archives as social constructs, power-sensitive conversations, interfaces of past–present–future—that can be adapted to theorise computational archives and AI training data.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “Archives, then, are not passive storehouses of old stuff, but active sites where social power is negotiated, contested, confirmed.” (p. 1)
- “Archives are social constructs. Their origins lie in the information needs and social values of the rulers, governments, businesses, associations, and individuals who establish and maintain them.” (p. 3)
- **Paraphrase:** The nature of the resulting archive has serious consequences for administrative accountability, citizen rights, collective memory and historical knowledge; these are shaped by largely invisible, rarely questioned power (p. 4).
- “When power is denied, overlooked, or unchallenged, it is misleading at best and dangerous at worst. Power recognized becomes power that can be questioned, made accountable, and opened to transparent dialogue and enriched understanding.” (p. 2)
- “Archives have always been about power…They both reflect and constitute power relations.” (p. 13)
- **Paraphrase:** The refusal of the archival profession to acknowledge power relations in the archival enterprise amounts to an abdication of responsibility for the consequences of that power (p. 6).
- “To choose not to engage in these debates is, in fact, a strong choice in favour of the status quo, with all its implications for buttressing mainstream power.” (p. 19)

## Questions for further research
- How can Schwartz and Cook’s analysis of power be operationalised for **digital and computational archives**, including AI training datasets and RAG systems?
- What empirical methods best capture the **layered interventions** (creators, records managers, archivists, system designers) that shape what survives as data?
- How can the project systematically identify and analyse **structural missingness** arising from appraisal, selection and description practices?
- What would it mean to redesign archival and data infrastructures to **acknowledge and redistribute power**, rather than deny it, while avoiding romanticisation of marginalised groups (pp. 15–18)?
