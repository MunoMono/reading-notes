# Scope of this note
This note critically reads the *Preface* and Part I (Chapters 1–2) of Schön’s book, as provided in the supplied extract (PDF pp. 1–78; book pp. vii–68). It focuses on Schön’s epistemology of practice—*knowing-in-action*, *problem setting* (naming/framing), and *reflection-in-action*—as conceptual machinery for making *epistemic drift* observable across design methods and institutional knowledge work, and for informing computational reconstruction (Strands 1–3 in the project model).

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Schön’s core objective is to develop an “epistemology of practice” adequate to professional competence under conditions that defeat standard applications of research-based technique—complexity, uncertainty, instability, uniqueness, and value conflict. The argument is that the dominant “Technical Rationality” model mis-describes professional work by over-privileging instrumental problem solving and suppressing *problem setting* and *artistry*; reflective practice is proposed as a rigorous mode of inquiry within action rather than a romantic residue of “intuition”. (pp. vii–viii; pp. 20–21; pp. 49–51)

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
Schön uses qualitative, interpretive analysis of practice “vignettes” and “protocols of actual performance”, concentrating on episodes in which senior practitioners help novices learn to act competently. The approach assumes practitioners “know more than they can say” (tacit knowing-in-practice), while claiming that models of this knowing can be constructed and *tested* from observed sequences of action and talk. The “sample” is described programmatically as a collection of vignettes across professions (including architects, psychotherapists, engineers, planners, managers), though the extract does not include the later chapters where these cases are developed in depth. (p. viii; p. 9)

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **A crisis of legitimacy exposes an epistemic deficit.** The professions’ public standing is undermined not only by misconduct but by visible failures and unintended harms; the deeper disturbance is that leading professionals cannot adequately *describe, justify, or teach* the competences now seen as central to practice. (pp. 3–4; pp. 11–12; pp. 19–20)
2. **Technical Rationality is an incomplete epistemology of practice.** It treats practice as rigorous problem solving via scientific technique, yet ignores problem setting: problems must be *constructed* from “puzzling, troubling, and uncertain” situations through naming and framing boundaries, objects, ends, and means. (pp. 21–22; p. 49)
3. **Reflection-in-action is a form of inquiry that can resolve the “rigor or relevance” dilemma.** In “swampy lowlands” of messy, high-stakes problems, practitioners can reflect in the “action-present”, surfacing tacit assumptions, reframing situations, and running “on-the-spot experiments” that generate new understanding and change the situation. This inquiry does not separate means/ends or thinking/doing, and can be “rigorous in its own right”. (pp. 42–43; pp. 51–52; pp. 61–62; pp. 67–68)

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
Schön’s conceptual triad—*knowing-in-action*, *reflection-in-action*, *problem setting*—offers a mechanism for how *epistemic drift* becomes observable within practice:
- **Strand 1 (historical emergence in design research):** drift can be read as the gradual stabilisation and routinisation of repertoires (“knowing-in-practice becomes tacit, spontaneous, and automatic”), producing selective inattention and “overlearning”; reflection functions as a corrective that re-opens framing and problem setting. (pp. 59–61)
- **Strand 2 (material recording/structuring/obscuring):** Schön’s account implies that institutions reward technical expertise and routinised categories, discouraging reflective articulation; this aligns with the project’s concern that record-keeping infrastructures can obscure the situated work of naming and framing.
- **Strand 3 (multimodal ML/visual analytics):** Schön foregrounds a methodological problem that mirrors computational reconstruction: observers must invent language to describe tacit theories-in-action, converting embodied “feel” into explicit “theory” and then testing it. This is a direct analogue to modelling choices in ML that make some patterns legible while distorting others. (pp. 58–59)

## What the authors bring to the table
### Key contributions and claims
- **A diagnosis of professional knowledge as epistemologically mis-specified:** the professions are “bound to an epistemology of practice” that cannot explain competences increasingly valued in real-world work. (p. 20)
- **A vocabulary that travels across domains:** “Technical Rationality”, “problem setting”, “naming and framing”, “knowing-in-action”, “reflection-in-action”, and “action-present” provide operational handles for analysing practice without reducing it to either technique or mystique. (pp. 49–51; p. 61)
- **An argument for rigor within action:** reflection-in-action is framed as inquiry embedded in doing, with iterative experiments that revise understanding and transform the situation; this reframes rigor as *situated* rather than exclusively laboratory-bound. (pp. 67–68)
- **A topography of practice:** the “high, hard ground” versus “swampy lowland” metaphor specifies where technique works and where it fails, and why the most socially important problems cluster in indeterminate terrain. (pp. 51–52)

### How the project responds to this evidence
- **Building on:** the doctoral project can adopt Schön’s account of *problem setting* as the core site where drift becomes visible: shifting frames, boundary judgements, and category choices can be treated as traceable events rather than background noise. (p. 49)
- **Challenging:** the project can press Schön on power and infrastructure: reflective capability is not merely personal artistry but is enabled or suppressed by institutional settings that privilege certain categories, methods, and accountabilities.
- **Informing practice:** Schön’s method implies concrete research tactics for practice-led design research: capture “protocols of performance” (including multimodal traces) and analyse episodes where practitioners encounter surprise, revise frames, and test new descriptions in action. (p. viii; pp. 61–62)

## Positioning this work
### What this literature will do for the project
- **Advance the argument:** it supplies an epistemological justification for treating situated, practice-led inquiry as rigorous rather than anecdotal—an essential move for arguing that epistemic drift is best observed in the “action-present” where frames are made and remade. (pp. 67–68)
- **Fill a gap:** it formalises a middle ground between positivist technique and anti-analytic “intuition”, supporting a research design that is empirically grounded in practice traces yet analytically explicit. (pp. vii–viii)
- **Provide analytical categories:** naming/framing and repertoires of expectation can become coding dimensions for historical method analysis and for computational pipelines that seek to surface drift.

### What this literature will not do
- **Boundaries for this project:** the extract does not include Schön’s later, domain-specific chapters (design, planning, organisational learning), which are likely to contain the richest design-relevant empirical cases (e.g., “Design as a reflective conversation with the situation”). Any design-specific claims should therefore be deferred until those chapters are read in full.
- **Unanswered questions:** Schön does not, in the sections provided, specify robust criteria for evaluating the quality of reflection-in-action beyond plausibility and pragmatic success, leaving open how reflective inquiry can be audited, compared, or ethically governed within institutional power relations.
- **Limitations for Strand 2:** the provided chapters imply institutional constraints but do not yet theorise record-keeping systems, classification regimes, or archival politics in the way the project requires.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- **Mechanism for drift:** routinised practice produces tacit repertoires and selective inattention; reflection “surfaces and criticises” tacit understandings, offering a model of how drift accumulates and how it can be interrupted. (pp. 60–61)
- **Operationalising the unit of analysis:** “problem setting” is described as naming objects, setting boundaries, and imposing coherence; these are observable operations that can be traced historically and computationally. (p. 49)
- **Bridge to computational reconstruction:** the conversion from knowing-in-action (“feel”) to verbalised “theories-in-action” is described as an inevitable, constructed translation; this legitimises a cautious stance to ML-based representation while making its epistemic costs explicit. (pp. 58–59)
- **Rigor/relevance as a design-methods dilemma:** the “high ground”/“swamp” framing supplies language for defending why the project must study messy design and archival realities rather than only technically neat proxies. (pp. 51–52)

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Conceptual precision with practical traction:** Schön identifies a genuine mismatch between institutionalised accounts of knowledge and lived competence, and supplies vocabulary that can be operationalised in empirical analysis. (pp. 19–21; p. 49)
- **A credible account of rigor without scientism:** reflection-in-action is framed as inquiry with iterative testing and consequential feedback, avoiding both positivist reduction and anti-intellectual celebration of “intuition”. (pp. vii–viii; pp. 67–68)
- **Sensitivity to unintended consequences:** the crisis framing recognises that technical expertise can generate harms and legitimacy failures, which is structurally aligned with ethics-of-classification concerns in the wider reading programme. (pp. 11–12)

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Evidence structure in the extract is promissory:** the methodological claims (vignettes, protocols, testing models) are not demonstrably executed in the provided chapters; the argument depends on later empirical chapters not included here.
- **Risk of individualising systemic issues:** the corrective is often cast as the practitioner’s reflective capacity; institutional power, incentives, and infrastructures that shape what counts as knowledge remain under-analysed in Part I.
- **Ambiguity of evaluation criteria:** “rigor in its own right” is asserted more than specified; the account risks collapsing into pragmatic success unless criteria for epistemic and ethical adequacy are made explicit. (p. viii; pp. 67–68)
- **Translation problem flagged but not resolved:** Schön notes that describing tacit knowing requires constructed language; this is an important warning, but it also undermines any easy move from practice trace to stable category—precisely the hazard the project must manage in ML reconstruction. (pp. 58–59)

### Author’s credibility
Schön writes from extensive professional and academic experience (industrial consulting, technology management, planning, policy analysis, teaching in a professional school) and situates the work within MIT’s research environment. He acknowledges intellectual debts to figures associated with organisational learning and reflective practice (notably Chris Argyris), indicating a networked programme rather than a solitary manifesto. (p. vii; p. x)

### Contextual validity
The argument is positioned as cross-professional and grounded in recurring conditions of practice (uncertainty, uniqueness, value conflict). However, without the later empirical chapters in view, generalisability rests on plausibility and resonance rather than demonstrative breadth; the model is best treated as a *heuristic framework* to be tested against the project’s design and archival cases.

### Comparisons
- **Versus Archer (systematic method):** Archer’s systematicity tends to assume problems can be formalised; Schön argues that the decisive work is *problem setting* in indeterminate contexts, where method-as-procedure is insufficient. (p. 49)
- **Versus Rittel & Webber (wicked problems):** both resist technical closure; Schön adds micro-epistemic mechanics (frames, action-present experiments) that specify how practitioners cope *during* action rather than only diagnosing problem structure. (pp. 61–62)
- **Versus Cross (designerly ways of knowing):** Cross articulates a domain-specific epistemology for design; Schön supplies a general epistemology of professional artistry that can underwrite design-specific claims while avoiding exceptionalism.
- **Versus Bowker & Star / Schwartz & Cook:** Schön’s critique of technical categories resonates with classification-as-politics; those works provide the infrastructural and ethical account that Schön’s Part I largely brackets.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Schön’s account can be read as an early theory of *epistemic drift* within professional repertoires: stability yields tacit automation; tacit automation yields selective inattention and rigidity; legitimacy crises emerge when routine expertise collides with messy, value-laden realities. Reflection becomes an epistemic “reset” mechanism that reopens framing, at the cost of making implicit assumptions contestable. (pp. 59–61; pp. 67–68)

For the project, the key implication is methodological: drift is not only a property of texts or models, but of *situated framing work*—often unrecorded unless specifically instrumented. The project can therefore treat reflective episodes (surprise → reframing → experiment → revised understanding) as the primary unit for historical tracing and for multimodal reconstruction pipelines. (pp. 61–62)

### Critical thinking and rigour
Schön employs:
- **Epistemic critique:** he diagnoses the positivist inheritance embedded in professional education and institutional legitimacy claims. (pp. 48–49)
- **Concept formation:** he builds mid-level concepts that can be used for analysis rather than mere exhortation (naming/framing; action-present).
- **Case-based reasoning (promised):** he proposes protocol-based modelling and testing of tacit knowing, though the extract does not allow full evaluation of execution.
Overall, argumentation is rigorous at the level of conceptual architecture and problem diagnosis; empirical rigor must be assessed once the later chapters are read in full.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- '**Quote:** “We are in need of inquiry into the epistemology of practice.” (p. viii) (p. viii)
- '**Quote:** “Problem setting is a process in which, interactively, we name the things to which we will attend and frame the context in which we will attend to them.” (p. 49) (p. 49)
- **Paraphrase:** Schön argues that the celebrated rigor of technical problem solving depends on prior framing work that is itself non-technical; when ends conflict or situations are unique, technique cannot simply be applied because the “problem” does not yet exist as a stable object. (pp. 41; 49–51) (pp. 41; pp. 49–51)

## Questions for further research
- Under what institutional conditions does reflection-in-action become recordable and accountable rather than informal and disposable?
- What counts as “rigor” for reflective inquiry in practice-led design research, and how can those criteria be made auditable without collapsing into Technical Rationality?
- How can multimodal ML models surface frames, surprises, and experiments without re-imposing “junk categories” that stabilise drift rather than reveal it? (p. 68)
- How does reflective problem setting interact with classification regimes and archival infrastructures that privilege certain boundaries and “things” over others?
- What historical evidence (methods texts, institutional guidelines, training materials) shows shifts in the legitimacy of reflective practice within design research over time?
