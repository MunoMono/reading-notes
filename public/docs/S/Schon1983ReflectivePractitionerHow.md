# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** I need an account of “knowing in practice” that makes epistemic shift legible in methods work, not just in theory.  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Methods / epistemology of practice: shift can be demonstrated through shifts in problem framing, tacit criteria, and what counts as “rigour” in action.  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** “Reflection-in-action” names a specific mechanism (framing + experimenting while acting) rather than a vague “reflection” or “iteration”. It helps me evidence shift via practice traces.  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will use Schön only when I can point to (1) a trace of reframing or in-action experimenting, and (2) an explicit change in criteria/benchmarks of “good” work (with page-cited support + an archive/practice pointer).

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Donald A. Schön is writing in the early 1980s against professional education models that treat practice as applied science (“Technical Rationality”). He is working in a tradition concerned with professional knowledge, uncertainty, and judgement in practice, and he argues that practice contains its own epistemology.  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Schön’s examples assume stable professional roles and largely text-based practice settings. I need to carry his “reflection-in-action” into institutional archives and computational reconstruction without treating the archive as neutral.

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to legitimise “reflection-in-action” as professional knowing by showing that technical problem solving is too narrow for real practice, and by proposing an epistemology of practice grounded in framing and in-action experimenting.

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** The dominant model of professional knowledge (“Technical Rationality”) fails in messy situations because it cannot handle uncertainty, uniqueness, and value conflict.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Schön contrasts a “high, hard ground” where research-based technique works with a “swampy lowland” of confusing “messes” and frames this as a “dilemma of ‘rigor or relevance’”. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, p. 41]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If the accepted model only counts “rigour” when problems fit pre-set categories, then the most consequential work (in the swamp) becomes epistemically downgraded even though it is central to practice.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** I use Schön to argue that epistemic shift shows up when institutions shift what they count as “rigorous” work, especially when practice moves from “technical solutions” to framing and negotiation in messy contexts.
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR example where description/classification treats ambiguity as “noise” or excludes it)

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** Professional competence depends on tacit “knowing-in-action”, and reflection-in-action surfaces and reshapes that tacit knowing while work is underway.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Schön says knowing is ordinarily tacit “in our action”; when surprised, practitioners reflect on what they notice, the criteria for their judgements, and “how am I framing the problem”, then “surface, criticize, restructure” understandings “embodied in further action”. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, pp. 48–49]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If key epistemic work is tacit and becomes visible through surfacing and reframing, then the “testament” of shift will often be traces of changed criteria, changed framing, and changed action sequences.
- **So what for my thesis:** I treat “reflection-in-action” as a way to locate shift in archival traces: I look for records that show a shift in framing, criteria, or judgement, not just a change in stated method.
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (identify a DDR record chain that shows a reframe: revised description, changed taxonomy term, altered selection criteria)

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** Reflection-in-action makes the practitioner a “researcher in the practice context” and can resolve the rigour/relevance dilemma by building an epistemology of practice.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Schön argues that in reflection-in-action practitioners “become a researcher in the practice context”, construct “a new theory of the unique case”, define means and ends interactively, and that studying this may “dissolve” the dilemma of rigour or relevance by developing an “epistemology of practice”. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, p. 68]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If practice can be rigorous on its own terms, then shift is not only an error/degradation; it can be an epistemic reconfiguration where new inquiry forms become legitimate.
- **So what for my thesis:** I use Schön to justify treating DDR archival work (and computational reconstruction) as a site of inquiry in its own right, where shift can be evidenced and made usable.
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (map a DDR workflow where in-action decisions generate new categories/inscriptions)

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Technical Rationality:** a model where professional action is framed as applying established theory/technique to well-formed problems. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, p. 41]``
- **High, hard ground / swampy lowland:** a diagnostic contrast for where technique fits versus where framing and judgement dominate. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, p. 41]``
- **Knowing-in-action:** tacit competence embedded in action that the practitioner cannot fully state. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, p. 48]``
- **Reflection-in-action:** in-situ inquiry triggered by surprise, where tacit understandings are surfaced and reshaped through action/experimenting. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, pp. 48–49; p. 68]``
- **Framing / problem setting:** the work that defines what the “problem” is and which ends/means are in play. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, p. 41]``

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - shift can be evidenced through shifts in framing and criteria, not only explicit method statements. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, pp. 48–49]``
  - An epistemology grounded in practice traces aligns with “testamentary traces” in an archive. ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, p. 68]``
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - Treat “rigour” as a moving benchmark and track how institutions define/enforce it through inscriptions (forms, descriptions, categories). ``[@Schon1983ReflectivePractitionerHow, p. 41]``
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What counts as a “testament” of reflection-in-action inside an institutional archive (revisions, annotations, classification changes)?

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Methods chapter: justify why shift is evidenced through practice traces and not only through published theory.
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention: Donald A. Schön’s *The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action* (1983).
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO (DDR example: description record that changes over time and shows changed criteria)
- **Workstreams →** DDR archive reading; definitions/benchmarks; practice-led method account
- **Deliverables →** shift evidence rubric (framing/criteria/action traces); annotated DDR case study
- **Stakeholders →** RCA DDR archive; examiners; readers unfamiliar with design research canon

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** Useful where I can evidence reframing and tacit criteria through traces; less useful when the archive provides only static outputs with no record of judgement or iteration.
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I cite Schön without concrete traces, “reflection-in-action” becomes a vibe word that inflates shift claims without evidence.

- **Short note form:** Schön, *Reflective Practitioner*, 41.
- **One quote worth lifting (≤2 lines):** “In the varied topography of professional practice, there is a high, hard ground… and there is a swampy lowland where situations are confusing ‘messes’ incapable of technical solution.” (p. 41)
- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** Reflection-in-action is triggered by surprise; the practitioner reflects on what they notice and the criteria they are using, then restructures those understandings through further action. (pp. 48–49)
