# Scope of this note
Focuses on Simon’s conception of design as a process of continual adaptation—an “evolving artifact” shaped through feedback, bounded rationality, and iterative learning. This provides the historical and conceptual bridge between Archer’s systematicism and contemporary understandings of design as a reflexive, computational system.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Simon examines how design can operate as a method of social planning within conditions of bounded rationality. He asks how societies can be “designed” when goals are uncertain, actors adaptive, and systems dynamic—how planning can remain effective without presuming stability. His purpose is to extend design thinking from technical artefacts to social and organizational systems.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
This is a theoretical essay derived from Simon’s *The Sciences of the Artificial* (1996). Using case comparison (NASA’s Moon landing vs. the U.S. Constitution), he illustrates how large-scale design is constrained by limited foresight and complex adaptation. He draws from systems theory, organizational design, and evolutionary logic to model design as a recursive, feedback-driven process.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Designing is evolutionary:** social systems evolve through iterative adaptation rather than linear goal attainment.  
2. **Bounded rationality** constrains foresight—effective design simplifies, prototypes, and learns through feedback.  
3. **Goals are provisional:** “final” goals are replaced by criteria for setting the next stage of design; progress is measured by flexibility and variety.  
4. **Organizations are the medium of design:** social and political structures both constrain and enable design action.  
5. **Designing itself is a valued activity:** the process of envisioning alternatives is both epistemic and moral progress.  

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
Simon’s notion of “designing the evolving artifact” underpins the DDR’s mid-1970s systems discourse—especially Archer’s modelling methods and their shift toward open-ended, adaptive inquiry. His treatment of bounded rationality and iterative goal formation directly informs the project’s interpretation of the DDR archive as an evolving system of epistemic adaptation rather than a closed repository.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Positions design as a **recursive system of decision-making**, paralleling the DDR’s own iterative models of method development and reflective practice (pp. 139–141).  
- Establishes the **concept of bounded rationality** as the intellectual antecedent of design’s plural, reflexive modes (pp. 150–155).  
- Articulates **planning without fixed goals** as a prototype for project-grounded, practice-led inquiry—anticipating research-through-design (pp. 162–165).  
- Provides conceptual scaffolding for **design as infrastructure**, aligning with the project’s digital-archival approach where the system learns through user feedback.  

**Positions design as an evolving system—an artefact that adapts through feedback and iteration. This anticipates both DDR’s systems logic and your own “living infrastructure” model of taxonomy and code. Quote briefly in *Taxonomic Reframing*: the DDR’s database and RAG schema operate as evolving artefacts that learn through use. Simon bridges Archer’s systematicism and your computational reflexivity.**

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Methodological spine; epistemic drift from systematic design to adaptive systems.  
- **Deliverables →** Conceptual foundation for the DDR’s digital taxonomy as a self-adaptive infrastructure.  
- **Stakeholders →** RCA archivists, digital humanists, and computational designers seeking to operationalise iterative classification.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Deeply integrative systems view uniting social science, design, and organizational theory.  
- Provides an enduring model for adaptive design reasoning and evolutionary planning.  
- Anticipates later paradigms of complexity, feedback, and emergence central to design research.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- Abstract and idealised; lacks empirical validation.  
- Frames adaptation within technocratic rationality, underplaying social contestation and cultural bias.  
- The analogy between biological and social evolution risks determinism.

### Author’s credibility
Herbert A. Simon (Nobel Laureate, 1978) was a foundational figure in cognitive psychology, economics, and design theory. His credibility is unquestioned, though his rationalist bias limits engagement with critical and posthumanist perspectives.

### Contextual validity
Simon’s model generalises effectively to large-scale planning and design processes but assumes Western institutional stability. Its application to plural or decolonial contexts requires critical reinterpretation.

### Comparisons
Bridges Archer’s “systematic design” with Schön’s “reflective practice,” and anticipates Jonas’s cybernetic and reflexive “research through design.” His conception of design as evolutionary aligns with later mode 2 science discourse.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Simon’s “designing without final goals” reframes design as a generative, recursive act of world-making. For the DDR project, this validates the treatment of archival taxonomies and RAG architectures as *living systems*—learning through interaction and iteration. His model supports the idea that methodological frameworks themselves are design artefacts subject to evolution.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory
- Encourages viewing **research infrastructures as adaptive artefacts**.  
- Reinforces iterative evaluation as a design process rather than a postscript.  
- Suggests that digital infrastructures should embed **bounded rationality**—simplifying complexity while allowing reflexive feedback.  

### How does it shape your thinking?
It situates the project’s computational approach within a lineage of design as *evolving system*, legitimising iterative, feedback-driven taxonomic modelling as both scholarly method and design practice.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “The idea of final goals is inconsistent with our limited ability to foretell or determine the future.” (p. 164)  
- “Designing without final goals has much in common with the processes of biological evolution.” (p. 165)  
- **Paraphrase:** Simon treats every design as an evolving artefact that adapts through feedback, iteration, and bounded rationality—an open system where design is both a method of learning and a form of societal evolution. (pp. 162–167)

## Questions for further research
- How can Simon’s “evolving artefact” be operationalised in computational design infrastructures?  
- In what ways can bounded rationality be reinterpreted through posthumanist or AI-informed design epistemologies?  
- How might the DDR’s iterative projects exemplify Simon’s model of “designing without final goals”?
