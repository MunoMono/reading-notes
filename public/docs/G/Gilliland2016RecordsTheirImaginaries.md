# Scope of this note
This note concentrates on Gilliland and Caswell’s conceptual intervention: introducing **impossible archival imaginaries** and **imagined records** as analytic terms that foreground affect, absence, and aspiration in archival theory and practice. It focuses on (i) how the authors justify an expanded evidentiary frame beyond legal-bureaucratic notions; (ii) the typology of imaginaries and the conditions that generate imagined records; and (iii) the methodological consequences for description, retrieval and ethics. It is read as a critical hinge between infrastructure/classification politics (Bowker and Star) and archival power/mediation (Schwartz and Cook), with particular relevance to a PhD examining epistemic drift as it is produced and stabilised through institutional memory systems and their computational reconstructions. (pp. 55–57, 71–72)

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
The paper argues that archival theory and practice must explicitly acknowledge the roles of **individual and collective imaginings** about **absent, inaccessible or unattainable archives and records**, because such imaginings generate affects and effects that shape institutions and publics. The authors’ objective is twofold:
- **Conceptual:** to propose and define *impossible archival imaginaries* and *imagined records* as theoretical tools that “augment” archival theory’s descriptive and explanatory capacities, especially where dominant evidentiary regimes (legal, bureaucratic, historical, forensic) fail to account for why archives motivate, inspire, anger, or traumatise. (pp. 55–56)
- **Transdisciplinary:** to “return” these concepts as contributions to other fields (human rights, cultural studies, postcolonial scholarship) from which the cases are drawn, thereby positioning archival studies as theory-generating rather than merely service-providing. (p. 56)

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
This is a conceptual-analytic paper with a comparative case-based structure (no primary dataset). Its method comprises:
- **Reflexive anchoring in the authors’ human-rights research**, using the deaths of indicted war-crimes suspects (Ieng Sary; Slobodan Milošević) to illustrate “forever-unavailable imagined evidence” and to motivate the need for new archival concepts. (pp. 56–57)
- **Interdisciplinary theory review** of “the imaginary” across anthropology, psychoanalysis, philosophy, nationalism studies, feminist and decolonial scholarship (Appadurai; Strauss; Sartre; Lacan; Castoriadis; Anderson; Taylor; Pérez), used to situate “imaginary” as socially consequential cognition and to warn against homogenising whose imaginary is being described. (pp. 58–61)
- **Illustrative “archival stories”** (secondary cases) that show imaginaries at work: JFK assassination records (including the Zapruder film; Oliver Stone’s JFK); Moroccan secret police archive beliefs; Aboriginal clients’ fears/absences in NSW state records; UFOlogy archives; Cooper’s Donuts riot; Michael Brown body-camera imaginaries; Eric Garner/Tamir Rice video evidence; refugee identity documentation practices; feminist “critical fabulation” (Hartman) and archival absence-as-productive (Arondekar). (pp. 62–70)
- **Conceptual synthesis** culminating in proposed definitions and practice implications (description, retrieval, ethics), framed as an argument for taking affect seriously and complicating the record–event linkage. (pp. 71–72)

The “sample” is therefore rhetorical and comparative: a curated set of cases spanning state violence, popular media, community memory, and scholarly method.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Archival theory’s focus on the actualised, accessible record is conceptually insufficient.** Dominant archival regimes prioritise records with presence and established evidentiary capacity, leaving little space to address the affective and political force of absence, withheld materials, and unattainable archives. The authors argue that imaginaries and imagined records are not anomalies but durable forces that shape archives and publics. (pp. 55–56)
2. **Impossible archival imaginaries and imagined records can function societally like records because absence has weight.** Imagined records arise under conditions such as missing/insufficient evidence, contested interpretations, or distrust of official infrastructures, and they can motivate political mobilisation, provide aspirational futures, or sustain collective grief—sometimes even when extant records fail to deliver justice. (pp. 64–67, 71)
3. **Affect is epistemically central, not a soft add-on.** The paper argues for treating affect as a key dimension of record/archives work and for revising how archival theory links records to events, authenticity, and evidence. Imagined records challenge classic “trustworthiness” assumptions by highlighting “authenticity as to deployment” and the dependence of evidence on social will and interpretive fields. (pp. 67–68, 71–72)

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
For a PhD concerned with epistemic drift across design methods, institutional archives, and computational reconstruction, this paper supplies a missing layer in the drift story: not only do records drift through classification and mediation, but **absence itself becomes an epistemic actor** through imaginaries that fill gaps, contest official narratives, and shape the future trajectories of institutions and communities. Imagined records therefore become a mechanism by which epistemic drift is socially produced and stabilised even without documentary instantiation. (pp. 55–57, 71)

The paper also directly constrains computational reconstruction: it demonstrates that more documentation does not automatically yield justice (Garner video), and that interpretive fields (racialised perception) govern how records “speak”. Any computational instrument that treats record presence as epistemic closure will reproduce the evidentiary failures the authors diagnose. (pp. 66–68)

## What the authors bring to the table
### Key contributions and claims
- **Two new concepts with definitions and scope conditions:**  
  - *Impossible archival imaginaries* explain situations where the archive and hoped-for contents are absent or “forever unattainable”, yet generate personal and collective affects and political effects. (pp. 61–62)  
  - *Imagined records* are conjured “documents” or evidentiary forms that function socially as records because of affective investment, aspirational trajectory, or the weight of absence. (pp. 56–57, 65–67)
- **A critique of evidentiary reductionism:** dominant legal/bureaucratic notions of evidence “fall short” in explaining how records motivate and traumatise; archival theory must widen epistemic frames to include affect and pluralist epistemologies. (pp. 55–56, 71)
- **A practice-facing agenda:** archivists should rework description, retrieval, and use to account for absences and attending affects; where ethics demands, archivists should strive to turn impossible imaginaries into possibilities. (pp. 71–72)
- **A warning about “who controls meaning”:** Taylor’s social imaginary and Strauss’s cautions are used to argue that archivists do not control wider understandings of “the record” or “the archive”, and that imaginaries must be interrogated as to whose they are. (pp. 60–61)

### How I respond to this evidence
- **Building on these claims:** The PhD can operationalise imaginaries as part of an infrastructural account of drift: absence and aspiration can be modelled as *forces shaping classification, description, and retrieval demands* (eg pressures for release, conspiracy narratives, community archiving interventions). (pp. 62–63)
- **Challenging or complicating:** The thesis can interrogate whether expanding “record” to include imagined records risks diluting archival accountability, especially where imaginaries are weaponised (the paper itself notes forgeries and dangerous effects). The key challenge is to preserve the critique of evidentiary supremacy without collapsing into epistemic relativism. (p. 57)
- **Informing thinking and practice:** The paper suggests a design brief for computational tools: build systems that represent *uncertainty, absence, and contested interpretation* rather than defaulting to binary presence/ground truth. It also justifies methods that treat “record failure” as analytical data rather than noise. (pp. 66–68, 71)

## Positioning this work
### What this literature will do for my project
- **Extend the project’s theory of drift to include absence, affect, and aspiration.** It provides a vocabulary for how epistemic drift can be produced through what cannot be archived (impossibility) and through what is willed into documentary existence (imagined records). (pp. 61–62, 71)
- **Strengthen an ethics-and-infrastructure frame.** It links recordkeeping to human rights, community identity, and justice, making the project’s institutional analysis ethically grounded rather than merely technical. (pp. 56–57, 71–72)
- **Provide a methodological counterweight to computational positivism.** It supplies cases in which extant audiovisual records do not secure accountability, demonstrating that record presence is not equivalent to evidentiary effectiveness. (pp. 66–68)

### What this literature will not do
- **It will not provide an empirical measurement protocol.** The paper is concept-generating and illustrative; it does not offer operational metrics for detecting imaginaries at scale or for evaluating interventions. (pp. 55–56)
- **It will not resolve normative trade-offs.** It argues for taking affect seriously and for ethical openness, but leaves open how institutions should adjudicate between conflicting imaginaries, or between harm minimisation and public accountability. (pp. 71–72)
- **It will not treat imaginaries as uniformly emancipatory.** While it foregrounds human-rights and community needs, it also signals that imaginaries can be manipulated and that forged records can wield “dangerous power”, but it does not fully theorise governance against such capture. (p. 57)

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- It provides explicit justification for analysing **absences and silences** as meaningful rather than as gaps to be merely “filled”, because imagined records can function socially like records due to the weight of absence and aspiration. (pp. 56, 71)
- It demonstrates that **evidence depends on interpretive fields** (racialised perception; Butler) and on institutional accountability processes (Drake), which supports treating computational outputs as situated claims rather than neutral facts. (pp. 67–68)
- It introduces **design-relevant practice implications**: reworking description and retrieval to take absences and affects into account, and engaging collective imaginaries to make archival endeavours relevant to disenfranchised communities. (p. 72)
- It offers an analytic bridge from archival theory to **method-making**: “complicating the link between record and event” supports thesis-level argumentation for pluralist epistemologies and for modelling records as co-constituted by affect and effect. (p. 71)

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Conceptual originality with practical consequence.** The introduction of two terms provides a durable vocabulary that surfaces what archival theory often sidelines: affect, absence, and aspirational futures. (pp. 55–56)
- **Empirically persuasive illustration across heterogeneous cases.** The breadth of cases (human rights trials, conspiracy archives, community memory, policing videos, refugee documentation, feminist historiography) demonstrates transferability and avoids a single-domain parochialism. (pp. 62–70)
- **A critical stance that remains practice-facing.** Rather than stopping at critique, the conclusion argues for revising description/retrieval/use practices and for engaging imaginaries ethically. (p. 72)
- **Epistemic caution valuable for digital methods.** The juxtaposition of nonexistent body-camera footage with existing but ineffective videos functions as a sharp critique of naïve documentary faith. (pp. 66–67)

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Operationalisation remains underdeveloped.** The paper proposes concepts and cases but does not specify how archivists (or researchers) should systematically document imaginaries, measure their effects, or evaluate interventions beyond general exhortation. (pp. 71–72)
- **Risk of concept sprawl.** “Imagined records” can range from political mobilisation to scholarly fabulation; without sharper boundary conditions, the term risks absorbing too much and losing analytic specificity. The authors partly counter this by naming recurring circumstances, but the taxonomy could be tightened. (pp. 64–65)
- **Governance tension.** The call to honour affect and plural epistemologies sits alongside acknowledgement that forgeries and conspiracy imaginaries can be dangerous; the paper gestures at this but offers limited guidance for institutional adjudication of harms. (p. 57)

### Author’s credibility
Both authors are senior archival scholars at UCLA with established research programmes in archival evidence, human rights, and community archives. The paper’s credibility is reinforced by its grounding in their prior work (post-conflict recordkeeping; human-rights documentation) and by engaged citation of cross-disciplinary scholarship on imaginaries and evidence. (pp. 56–58, 75)

### Contextual validity
The argument is most compelling in contexts of contested evidence and structural violence (human rights trials, policing, colonial archives, refugee status), where absences and distrust are endemic and where affect is not incidental but constitutive. Generalisation to mundane bureaucratic recordkeeping is plausible insofar as imaginaries still form around withheld or missing records, but the stakes and affects may be qualitatively different. (pp. 55–56, 64–66)

### Comparisons
- **With Schwartz and Cook (archives/records/power):** Gilliland and Caswell extend power/mediation critique by adding the immaterial layer: not only do archives shape memory through appraisal and description, but imaginaries shape institutions through absence, fear, and aspiration. (pp. 55–56, 62–63)
- **With Bowker and Star (classification consequences):** The paper complements infrastructure ethics by showing how categories of “unknown/unidentified” and residual absences generate affective evidence-like force; it expands “classification” into imaginaries and phenomenological archives. (pp. 63–64)
- **With feminist archival scholarship (Hartman; Arondekar):** It positions “critical fabulation” and reading absences as strategies that challenge epistemic regimes demanding written proof, thereby widening what counts as archival evidence and how historical knowledge is made. (pp. 69–70)

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- **Imaginaries as a drift mechanism at the boundary of record and institution.** The paper implies that when institutions cannot (or will not) provide records that publics need, imaginaries generate substitute evidentiary forms; these can redirect policy (body cameras), sustain distrust (JFK), or constitute community memory (Cooper’s Donuts). This is drift as social-cognitive infrastructure, not merely semantic change. (pp. 62–66)
- **Record failure as diagnostic evidence.** The Garner example undermines documentary faith: video presence does not secure accountability; what matters is the socio-legal apparatus that interprets and acts. For computational reconstruction, this implies that improving retrieval or completeness is insufficient without modelling interpretive governance and accountability pathways. (pp. 66–68)
- **Affect–effect coupling as a design constraint.** The question “can an imagined record… have an effect?” is answered affirmatively; the thesis can treat affective investment as a measurable driver of classification and access pressures (requests, petitions, mobilisation, narrative production). (p. 71)

### Critical thinking and rigour
The paper employs critical frameworks from cultural studies and STS: situated knowledge, critique of evidentiary supremacy, and analysis of how meaning is produced through absence and mediation. Its rigour is strongest in conceptual synthesis and careful triangulation across theoretical traditions (Taylor/Anderson/Appadurai; Sartre/Lacan; decolonial and feminist historiography) and in the systematic naming of conditions under which imagined records arise. It is weaker where it turns to practice prescriptions, which remain high-level and would benefit from methodological operationalisation (eg protocols for describing absences and associated affect). (pp. 60–61, 64–65, 72)

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- 'We propose two new terms: impossible archival imaginaries and imagined records.' (p. 53/54 in PDF; article introduction) (p. 53)  
- 'Affect… offer[s) important affective counterbalances and sometimes resistance to dominant legal, bureaucratic, historical and forensic notions of evidence…' (pp. 53–55 in PDF) (pp. 53–55)  
- **Paraphrase:** The authors argue that archival theory’s preoccupation with the instantiated and accessible record leaves little conceptual space to address how absences and unattainable archives generate narratives, distrust, aspiration, and political pressure that shape archives themselves. (pp. 55–56) (pp. 55–56)  
- **Paraphrase:** In the Michael Brown case, nonexistent body-camera footage becomes an imagined record invested with the power to secure truth and justice, even as actually existing videos in other cases fail to deliver accountability, showing that evidence depends on interpretive fields and institutional processes. (pp. 65–68) (pp. 65–68)

## Questions for further research
- How can institutional archives document and represent **absence** (missing, destroyed, unattainable records) alongside extant materials in ways that are ethically accountable and computationally legible? (pp. 57, 72)
- What governance mechanisms can distinguish between emancipatory imaginaries (community survival/justice) and harmful imaginaries (forgery, conspiratorial weaponisation) without reinstating evidentiary supremacy? (p. 57)
- How can computational reconstruction tools model **interpretive fields** (eg racialised perception, institutional accountability structures) rather than treating audiovisual documentation as self-evident proof? (pp. 67–68)
- In what ways do imagined records reshape appraisal, description, and access policies over time (petitions, disclosure laws, community archives), and how can those policy shifts be studied as epistemic drift? (pp. 62–66)
