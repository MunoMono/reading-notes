# Scope of this note

This note covers the full article, with particular emphasis on the definitions of **“impossible archival imaginaries”** and **“imagined records”**, and on the human-rights and feminist cases the authors use to illustrate how *absent* and *unattainable* records shape affect, politics and practice (p. 53). The focus is on how this framework complements work on archival silence and missingness in the project’s Strand 3.3.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

The paper asks how **imaginations about archives that do not (or cannot) exist** function alongside conventional records and evidence.

The authors explicitly argue that *“the roles of individual and collective imaginings about the absent or unattainable archive and its contents should be explicitly acknowledged in both archival theory and practice”* (p. 53). They propose two core concepts:

- **Impossible archival imaginaries**: collective imaginings about archives and records that are *absent or forever unattainable*.
- **Imagined records**: records that never existed in the anticipated or hoped-for form, but that operate socially as if they did (pp. 53, 56).

The aim is to show that these imaginaries and imagined records:

- Carry affective weight (hope, grief, anger, desire for justice).
- Can motivate social and political action.
- Expose the limits of dominant, legal-bureaucratic notions of evidence in explaining the power of records and archives (pp. 53, 55).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

The article is **conceptual and theoretical**, not empirical in the narrow sense.

- It begins with reflection on the authors’ own work on human-rights documentation (e.g. Khmer Rouge and Milosević trials) and the “imagined” evidentiary status of testimony that will never be given (pp. 56–57).
- It then **reviews theories of the imaginary** from Sartre, Lacan, Castoriadis, Anderson, Taylor, Appadurai and feminist/postcolonial scholars such as Emma Pérez and Anjali Arondekar (pp. 58–60).
- It develops the two key concepts through a set of **illustrative cases**:
  - Dever on embargoed Garbo letters and “pay-dirt” disappointment (pp. 54–55).
  - Dead perpetrators (Khmer Rouge, Milosević) and their never-given testimony as “imaginary documents” (pp. 56–57).
  - Conspiracy imaginaries around the JFK archives and the Zapruder film (pp. 61–62).
  - Secret or non-existent police archives in Morocco; Aboriginal Protection Board files in NSW; UFO archives; Cooper’s Donuts riot; body camera footage, refugee paperwork, and the lost Malcolm X photograph (pp. 61–70).
  - Feminist work on archival absence (Hartman’s “critical fabulation”, Arondekar’s “empty archive”) (pp. 68–69).

Rather than sampling a population, the authors **assemble a cross-disciplinary set of “archival stories”** to theorise how absences and imaginaries operate.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Impossible archival imaginaries: archives that will never materialise, but still matter**

   The authors introduce *impossible archival imaginaries* as imaginaries that operate *“in situations where the archive and its hoped-for contents are absent or forever unattainable”* (p. 61). These imaginaries:

   - May never produce actual records in a conventional sense.
   - Are “archivally impossible” but nevertheless shape expectations, suspicions and political claims (pp. 61–63).
   - Can be discerned in conspiracy cultures (JFK), in beliefs about secret police files (Morocco), or in communities’ conviction that records must exist somewhere, even when they do not.

2. **Imagined records: non-existent records functioning as evidence through affect**

   The authors distinguish imagined records from traditional records:

   - Conventional records are by-products of action and are evaluated as legal, administrative or historical evidence (p. 70].
   - In contrast, *“imagined records are created through and to provide evidence of affective reactions to such actions and acts as well as to the absence of desired documentation about them”* (p. 70).

   These imagined records:

   - Often arise when expected evidence does not exist, is inaccessible or fails to deliver justice.
   - Can “conjure” the possibility of closure, accountability or citizenship (e.g. body-cam footage for Michael Brown; refugee narratives standing in for missing documentation; the lost Malcolm X photograph) (pp. 65–67, 69–70).
   - May co-exist with real records, reinforcing or contesting official narratives.

3. **Absence is productive: silences generate affect, narratives and action**

   The paper shows that archival absence is *not* a neutral void:

   - Imagined records and impossible imaginaries are “pregnant with the possibility of establishing a proof, a perspective, a justice that heretofore has remained unattainable” (p. 72).
   - Even non-existent records can become **focal points for collective mobilisation** (e.g. campaigns for police body cameras), or for **mourning and identification** (e.g. Venus as composite figure of enslaved women) (pp. 65–69].
   - The authors argue that *“while such records do not actually exist, their weight, as manifestations of affect, as symbols of collective grief and aspiration…is immeasurable”* (p. 72).

4. **Challenge to narrow evidentiary paradigms**

   The paper concludes that archival theory must accommodate these phenomena:

   - *“Archival theory and practice can no longer afford to ignore such phenomena of the imagination”* (p. 72).
   - This requires “complicating the link between record and event” so that records conjured by affect (rather than created by discrete events) still figure in how archives are theorised (pp. 71–72).
   - The authors suggest extending concepts of **authenticity** to encompass records “authentic as to deployment” even when tampered with or forged, and pose the question whether this logic can also extend to imagined records (p. 71].

5. **Imaginaries connect absence and future possibilities**

   The paper stresses that imaginaries are not just about filling the past:

   - They “provide a trajectory to the future out of a particular perspective on the past” (p. 61).
   - The absent Malcolm X photograph, for instance, anchors not just a lost historical connection, but “possible futures…of community, solidarity, and inclusion” (p. 70).

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

For a project interested in **absence, silence and missing data**, this article is crucial because it reframes missingness as:

- **Affective and imaginative**, not only structural and technical.
- Something that lives both in *archives* and in *expectations* about archives.

Key links:

- Where Moss and Thomas focus on silences in *created* and *uncreated* archives, Gilliland and Caswell focus on what happens when people **imagine records that are not there**, or attribute power to archives they will never see.
- This supports a move away from treating missing data as mere error towards seeing **what people think should be there** as a central research object.
- For socio-technical systems, the idea of imagined records points towards how users imagine logs, datasets and “the algorithmic archive”, and how these imaginaries drive trust, mistrust and demands for transparency.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Conceptual vocabulary for “felt” missingness.**  
  The notions of *impossible archival imaginaries* and *imagined records* offer language for the *felt* side of missing data – how people emotionally and politically inhabit the gaps (pp. 61–62, 70–72).
- **Bridging evidence and affect.**  
  The article argues that imagined records *“broaden our definition of human rights documentation to include the affective needs of survivors and victims’ families”* (p. 57). This can be adapted to understand communities’ expectations of data and AI systems.
- **Design implications.**  
  Their call to “rework archival description, retrieval and use to take absences—and their attending affects—into account” (p. 73) maps directly onto questions about how interfaces surface absences, uncertainty and non-collection.
- **Authenticity and deployment.**  
  The argument that doctored or misused documents may be “authentic in relation to the purpose for which [they were] used” (p. 71) prompts reflection on how incomplete or biased datasets can still have very real effects.

## Critical evaluation

### Strengths

- **Novel concepts.**  
  Clear articulation of *impossible archival imaginaries* and *imagined records* fills an important gap in archival theory (pp. 61–62, 70–72).
- **Cross-disciplinary grounding.**  
  The authors synthesise anthropological, philosophical, feminist and postcolonial literatures on the imaginary, then “return” archival concepts to those fields (pp. 58–60).
- **Rich, concrete cases.**  
  Examples range from human-rights tribunals and police violence to UFO archives and transgender history, illustrating the breadth of phenomena the concepts can cover (pp. 61–70).
- **Attention to affect.**  
  The sustained focus on grief, hope, paranoia, distrust and aspiration emphasises that archives and data infrastructures are lived as well as technical systems (pp. 55–57, 61–65, 70–72).

### Weaknesses and limitations

- **No systematic empirical method.**  
  The cases are persuasive but selected illustratively; there is no explicit methodology for identifying or analysing imaginaries in a structured way.
- **Limited engagement with contemporary data infrastructures.**  
  Digital systems appear mainly in examples (body cams, digital video, UFO digital archives), but there is little analysis of algorithms, platforms or machine-learning datasets as such.
- **Ambiguity around operationalisation.**  
  The paper convincingly names phenomena but offers less guidance on how practitioners might respond in concrete archival or data-governance settings beyond a general call to “take affect seriously” (pp. 71–73).

### Author’s credibility

- Anne Gilliland is Professor of Archival Studies at UCLA and a leading figure in archival theory, human-rights archives and post-conflict recordkeeping (p. 75).
- Michelle Caswell is Assistant Professor of Archival Studies at UCLA and co-founder of the South Asian American Digital Archive; she is recognised for work on community archives and human-rights documentation (p. 75).

### Contextual validity

- The concepts travel well beyond the specific cases: any context where people believe records *ought* to exist but do not, or invest hope/fear in unseen datasets, can be analysed through this lens.
- Some examples are grounded in specific legal and political histories (e.g. JFK, Khmer Rouge, Moroccan commissions); these should be used as analogies rather than direct templates.

### Comparisons

- **With Moss & Thomas (Archival Silences).**  
  Moss and Thomas focus on structural silences in creation and assembly; Gilliland and Caswell focus on the *imaginative afterlife* of those silences—what people do with absent or uncreated records.
- **With Trouillot.**  
  Trouillot’s “silencing” is about the production of history; here the emphasis is on how people *respond* to silencing by imagining records, and on how those imaginaries shape future trajectories.
- **With Hartman and Arondekar.**  
  Hartman’s “critical fabulation” and Arondekar’s “archival aporia” are directly engaged: imagined records are positioned as ways of working with impossible stories, or of treating empty archives as full of interpretive possibility (pp. 68–69).

## Interpretation

### Analysis and insights

- The paper extends the project’s understanding of missingness from **“what is not there”** to **“what people believe is (or should be) there”**.
- It suggests that research on data infrastructures should pay attention to:
  - Rumours and stories about hidden databases or surveillance.
  - Campaigns built around imagined records (e.g. calls for logs, transparency reports, audits that do not yet exist).
  - The way absence generates new forms of “evidence” (e.g. community testimony, speculative narratives).
- It underlines that absence is not just a structural trace of power, but **a site of imaginative labour** where communities craft futures, solidarities and claims.

### Alternative explanations?

- Some phenomena the authors describe could be explained in more conventional terms (e.g. misinformation, conspiracy theory, bureaucratic disorganisation).
- Their value lies in showing that even when imaginaries are factually incorrect, they still shape behaviour, trust and politics; in other words, imaginaries are *empirically real* in their effects.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?

- **Practice:** Archivists and data stewards should anticipate that people will imagine records and archives; interface design and communication should therefore address expectations and perceived gaps.
- **Policy:** Debates about body cameras, data retention and transparency should be read not only in terms of evidence but also in terms of **imagined futures** that such records are supposed to enable.
- **Theory:** The project can treat **absence and imagination as coupled**: missing data and imagined data form a single analytic object.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase

- *“This paper argues that the roles of individual and collective imaginings about the absent or unattainable archive and its contents should be explicitly acknowledged in both archival theory and practice.”* (p. 53) (p. 53]
- *“What we are calling impossible archival imaginaries and the affect associated with the imagined records produced within those imaginaries, offer important affective counterbalances and sometimes resistance to dominant legal, bureaucratic, historical and forensic notions of evidence…”* (p. 55)
- *“The notion of impossible archival imaginaries… explains how archival imaginaries may work in situations where the archive and its hoped-for contents are absent or forever unattainable.”* (p. 61)
- **Paraphrase:** The authors define imagined records as records that never existed in the hoped-for form but are created through affective reactions to events and to the absence of documentation, and are used to support claims when formal evidence is lacking (p. 70).
- *“While such records do not actually exist, their weight, as manifestations of affect, as symbols of collective grief and aspiration, as evidence of the capacity of records to imagine impossible futures, is immeasurable…”* (p. 72)
- *“Archival theory and practice can no longer afford to ignore such phenomena of the imagination.”* (p. 72) (p. 72]
- **Paraphrase:** The authors call for archival description, retrieval and use to be reworked so that absences and the affects attached to them are taken into account, and for archivists to engage with collective imaginaries if archives are to matter to disenfranchised communities (p. 73).

## Questions for further research

- How can **impossible archival imaginaries** and **imagined records** be systematically studied in digital environments (e.g. around AI systems, platform data, government data infrastructures)?
- What methods (interviews, ethnography, interface analysis) best capture people’s **expectations and myths** about unseen datasets?
- How do imaginaries differ across groups (e.g. designers, officials, activists, marginalised communities), and how do these differences influence trust and engagement?
- Can design interventions make productive use of imaginaries—acknowledging them without over-promising what records and data can deliver?
