# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** To treat *absence + affect* as part of archival evidence-making, so “testament” is not only what exists, but also what is imagined, withheld, or never recorded.  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Literature review / archives-as-power + absence: activation requires designing for imaginaries (what people think should be there) not only “the record.”  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** “Imaginaries / imagined records” gives me a precise vocabulary for how absence generates force and narrative; it’s tighter than generic “memory” talk because it links directly to evidentiary failure + institutional practice.  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will only cite this where I can show (a) an absence/withholding/never-was record shaping interpretation, and (b) an affective/evidentiary consequence relevant to DDR activation.

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Gilliland (archival studies, UCLA) and Caswell (archival studies/community archives, UCLA) are writing in a post-“archival turn” moment where archives are treated as political infrastructures (human rights, community archives, affect). They intervene against dominant archival logics that privilege the actual/accessible record and legal–bureaucratic notions of evidence, arguing these miss how archives operate socially.  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** The “archive = what is preserved and retrievable” assumption is insufficient; the *imagined archive* and *imagined records* shape trust, legitimacy, and action. [@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, p. 55]

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to expand what counts as archival evidence by theorising *impossible archival imaginaries* and *imagined records* in order to account for how absence + affect can function socially like records and should be addressed in archival theory and practice. [@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, pp. 53–55]

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Archival theory/practice is structurally biased toward “actual, instantiated, accessible” records and therefore lacks concepts to deal with imagined/absent/unattainable records that still shape meaning and behaviour.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** They argue that dominant strands “maintain an unreflexive preoccupation” with the actual and accessible and offer “little conceptual space” for the imagined/absent; they propose *impossible archival imaginaries* and *imagined records* to address this gap. ``[@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, pp. 55–56]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If a field only legitimates what is present/retrievable, it cannot explain why embargo, secrecy, loss, and speculation produce real pressures, narratives, and institutional effects.
- **So what for my thesis (reusable sentence):** DDR activation must design for “the archive people think exists” (and what they fear/hope is inside), not only the archive-as-catalogue.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — pick a DDR case where an embargo/gap/rumour shaped interpretation or demand (archive ID / folder).

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** Imagined records can function as records because people act on them; their force often comes from affect (grief, distrust, aspiration) and from failures of official evidence regimes.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** They argue that “whatever…individual acts upon or invests in as a record…functions…as a record,” including records that exist “in the imaginary, premised in both affect and effect.” ``[@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, p. 57]``  
  They show an example where a nonexistent body-camera record becomes an imagined evidentiary object mobilising political action (Michael Brown). ``[@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, pp. 65–66]``
- **Warrant (my words):** Evidence is not only a property of documents; it is produced through belief, legitimacy, and use. When formal systems fail (or are distrusted), imaginaries become substitute infrastructures.
- **So what for my thesis (reusable sentence):** “Testament” in DDR can include *imagined records* created by absence—activation needs to make those imaginaries visible and contestable rather than pretending evidence is only what the catalogue lists.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — identify a DDR “should-have-been” record (lost documentation, missing photographs, absent correspondence) that stakeholders treat as decisive.

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** To respond ethically and effectively, archival practice must incorporate absences and affect into description/retrieval/use—sometimes by converting impossibility into possibility.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** They argue practice should “take affect seriously” and “envision new ways” for description/retrieval/use to take absences and their affects into account; in some cases, to “turn impossible archival imaginaries into possibilities.” ``[@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, pp. 71–72]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If absences are producing social effects (trust, fear, mobilisation), then describing only what exists is a mis-description of how the archive actually operates.
- **So what for my thesis (reusable sentence):** DDR activation can be framed as a design problem: represent not only what is present, but also what is missing/withheld/never-recorded and the affects attached to those gaps.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — map one DDR finding aid/metadata layer that could surface “known gaps” + “imagined contents” safely (prototype note link).

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Impossible archival imaginaries:** imaginaries that will not result in traditional actualised records, yet still shape narratives, legitimacy, and action. ``[@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, p. 61]``
- **Imagined records:** record-like objects produced through affect and absence; they can operate societally “in ways similar to actual records.” ``[@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, pp. 55–57]``
- **Affect (in archival context):** emotions/tensions shaping cognition and behaviour around records/archives (their definition frames it as both cognitive + behavioural). ``[@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, p. 55]``

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A clean vocabulary for “absence that acts”: imaginaries + imagined records gives me language to keep DDR gaps analytically productive rather than embarrassing.
  - A usable bridge between evidence theory and design: evidence is activated; therefore activation can be designed.
  - A clear cue for S2: infrastructures (registers, indexes, schedules) imply missingness and produce imaginaries. ``[@Gilliland2016RecordsTheirImaginaries, p. 56]``
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will treat “testament” as a designed evidentiary interface that includes *absence signals* (what’s missing, contested, embargoed) alongside artefacts.
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What is an ethical “representation of absence” for DDR that does not amplify conspiracy, but still makes imaginaries legible and discussable?

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Literature review section on archives-as-evidence + absence + affect (set up why DDR activation must include imaginaries).  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention: *Records and Their Imaginaries* (Gilliland & Caswell, 2016).  
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO — DDR case note where a missing/withheld item shaped interpretation or stakeholder demand.  
- **Workstreams →** S2 (archives/standards/power) + bridge to S3 (how computational reconstruction might surface absences safely)  
- **Deliverables →** “Absence + Imaginary layer” in DDR activation prototype (metadata + narrative constraints)  
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archive staff; RCA institutional governance; communities/users with expectations of what “should” be there

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** This is strongest for understanding *absence/affect/evidence* dynamics, not for prescribing a full technical activation pipeline.  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I cite this to justify speculation without grounding, I could legitimise “imagined records” as facts rather than as socially powerful imaginaries that must be handled carefully.

# Chicago NB payload (capture what you’ll need later)
- **Key pages to reuse:** p. 53–57, 61, 65–66, 71–72
- **First full note (write it out here):** TODO (generate from Zotero/CSL if needed)
- **Short note form:** TODO
- **One quote worth lifting (≤2 lines):** “...the roles of individual and collective imaginings about the absent or unattainable archive and its contents should be explicitly acknowledged...” (p. 55)  
- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** They argue that imagined/absent records can function socially as evidence because people invest belief and affect in them, especially when official evidentiary regimes fail (pp. 55–57; 65–66).
