# Scope of this note
This note critically reviews Galdon and Hall’s *(Un)Frayling Design Research in Design Education for the 21st Century* (2022). The paper re-examines Christopher Frayling’s 1993 *Research in Art and Design*, deconstructing its conceptual foundations and tracing its lineage through Archer (1968), Cross (1982), and Jones (1970). The authors argue that Frayling’s taxonomy—*into/through/for*—locks design research within a present-oriented epistemology that neglects design’s prospective, abductive and probabilistic nature. Their argument advances a temporal and ontological reframing of design knowledge that positions design as a future-led, world-making discipline.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
The paper seeks to redefine design research education for the 21st century by diagnosing the limitations of the Frayling model. Specifically, it asks:  
- Why did Frayling articulate his framework as he did, and what conceptual omissions does it contain?  
- How can design research be re-conceptualised around its prospective and abductive characteristics to address uncertainty and transformation?  

The aim is to *un-Frayling* design research: to move from taxonomic repetition toward an ontological and temporal reorientation that liberates design from the static paradigms of science and tacit knowledge.

---

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size
The study is **theoretical, historical and synthetic**. It proceeds through:
- **Historical reconstruction:** tracing the evolution of design research from Archer’s systematic design science through Cross’s *designerly knowing* to Frayling’s institutional typology.  
- **Critical deconstruction:** identifying contradictions and absences in these models, particularly their neglect of temporality.  
- **Conceptual synthesis:** proposing *prospectivity*, *abductivity* and *probabilistic knowledge* as the ontological core of design research.  
There is no empirical sample. The argument functions as **philosophical redescription** of the field’s epistemic foundations and an institutional critique of design education.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Frayling’s framework is historically situated and limited.** It systematised practice-based research but reduced design’s complexity to procedural categories. Its models address how design research might be conducted but not what design *is*.  
2. **Three epistemic problems:**  
   - *Factuality problem* (Archer): design cannot claim the reproducibility of science.  
   - *Transferability problem* (Cross): tacit knowledge resists codification.  
   - *Procedural problem* (Frayling): research becomes mere documentation.  
3. **Missing variable–time:** Archer, Cross and Frayling all operate in the present tense, neglecting the temporal dimension of design’s world-making orientation.  
4. **Prospectivity and abductivity:** design knowledge is future-oriented, provisional and generative rather than retrospective or purely interpretive.  
5. **Probabilistic knowledge:** design produces guiding, conditional knowledge—‘knowledge for’ future action, not ‘knowledge of’ the past (after Glanville, 2005).  
6. **Repositioning of design:** design research must be understood as directional, transformational and ethically accountable—concerned with *what ought to be* (Simon, 1996).  
7. **Educational implications:** design pedagogy should shift from documentation and classification toward abductive experimentation, responsibility and temporally aware world-making.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
This paper directly serves the project’s inquiry into the **epistemic drift** from systematic design to designerly knowing. Galdon and Hall complete the historical arc: Archer (systematic rationality) → Frayling (bureaucratic codification) → Galdon & Hall (prospective emancipation). Their 'temporal turn' reframes DDR’s legacy, suggesting that its closure under Archer and Frayling can be reopened through an abductive-probabilistic lens.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Supplies the **conceptual language of prospectivity and probabilism**, extending DDR’s operational rationality into an interpretive-futurist frame.  
- Reinforces the project’s **interpretivist–critical strand** by situating design knowledge as provisional and ethically accountable.  
- Offers a bridge between historical DDR research and contemporary *world-making* paradigms.  
- Provides a counter-taxonomy to Frayling’s triad, aligning with the project’s archival re-classification of DDR outputs.  

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** DDR epistemic reconstruction; comparative taxonomy (1968–2025); future-oriented methodological synthesis.  
- **Deliverables →** temporal-ontological framework for design research; visual map of epistemic drift from Archer to probabilism.  
- **Stakeholders →** design educators, research leaders, RCA archival curators, and epistemology scholars.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Historical depth:** situates Frayling within a long genealogy from Archer to Cross.  
- **Conceptual innovation:** introduces temporality and probabilism as missing dimensions.  
- **Ontological reframing:** moves design research beyond the binary of tacit vs explicit knowledge.  
- **Institutional reflexivity:** critiques RCA’s own intellectual lineage from within.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Abstraction:** lacks empirical exemplars to test the proposed model.  
- **Overgeneralisation:** risks presenting abductivity as universally characteristic of design.  
- **Limited engagement with feminist or decolonial epistemologies:** the 'future-led' framing could be read as universalising.  
- **Institutional insider bias:** both authors are RCA academics, potentially softening critique of institutional continuity.  

### Author’s credibility
Fernando Galdon (Lecturer, Innovation Design Engineering, RCA) and Ashley Hall (Professor of Design Innovation, RCA) are established design researchers. Their authority is grounded in both scholarly publication and institutional leadership, positioning this as an insider’s theoretical consolidation rather than an external critique.

### Contextual validity
The model generalises best within postgraduate design research and design-led innovation. Its emphasis on temporality and abductivity may have less traction in community, participatory or craft-based settings where temporality operates differently.

### Comparisons
- **Archer (1968, 1995):** systematic, present-bound, positivist rationality.  
- **Frayling (1993):** codifies design research as procedural taxonomy.  
- **Cross (1982):** introduces designerly knowing but omits temporal ontology.  
- **Jones (1970):** anticipates prospectivity; recovered here as precedent.  
- **Glanville (2005):** provides the epistemic pivot—‘knowledge for’.  
- **Gooding (2022):** parallels probabilistic transparency through *critical addressability*.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Galdon and Hall’s argument represents a **fourth epistemic phase** in design research. Where Archer pursued scientific rigour, Frayling sought institutional validation, and Cross emphasised designerly autonomy, Galdon and Hall advance *temporal autonomy*. Their ‘un-Frayling’ is not rejection but release—decoupling design research from its administrative typologies.  

For the DDR project, this text provides both closure and renewal: closure of the Archer–Frayling lineage and renewal through temporal and ethical reopening. It encourages reading DDR artefacts as probabilistic inscriptions—preliminary propositions rather than fixed truths. In this view, DDR’s systematic models become early experiments in abductive world-making.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- **Quote:** ‘This repositioning emancipates design research from the present, thus overcoming the scientific/tacit paradigms, and liberates design research to operate independently in its future-led prospective and transformational nature.’ (p. 930) → the paper’s thesis in one sentence.  
- **Paraphrase:** The authors identify ‘factuality’, ‘transferability’ and ‘procedural’ problems as legacies of Archer, Cross and Frayling; all stem from the absence of temporality in their epistemic models (pp. 918–922).  
- **Quote:** ‘We trade some degree of accuracy for access to areas that are partial and yet-to-be or not-fully-formed.’ (p. 922) → defines design’s probabilistic ontology.  
- **Paraphrase:** Introducing time adds accountability (past) and responsibility (future) to design research, expanding Archer’s model into ethical temporality (pp. 928–929).

## Questions for further research
- How can *probabilistic knowledge* be operationalised in design curricula and research evaluation?  
- What methodologies can capture design’s abductive temporality without reducing it to process diagrams?  
- How might feminist or non-Western epistemologies expand the model of prospectivity?  
- Can DDR archival data be re-analysed through a probabilistic lens to visualise epistemic drift?  
- What ethical frameworks accompany the shift from knowledge-of to knowledge-for?

## Takeaways for the DDR project
1. Galdon and Hall complete the historical arc from DDR’s systematic science to contemporary abductive futures.  
2. Their model provides a **temporal–ontological bridge** for re-interpreting DDR artefacts as anticipatory rather than archival.  
3. The project can deploy *probabilistic mapping* to visualise how DDR knowledge circulated as provisional, not final.  
4. Their redefinition of design as a *world-making* and *responsibility-laden* act connects DDR historiography to 21st-century ethical design research.
