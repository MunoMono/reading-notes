# Scope of this note
This note focuses on Candy and Edmonds’s attempt to stabilise definitions and doctoral expectations for practice-based research in the creative arts, with particular attention to (i) the research–practice distinction, (ii) the epistemic status of the artefact, and (iii) how doctoral submissions render practice-derived knowledge publicly scrutable (pp. 63–68). It is read against a project spine concerned with how knowledge becomes legible across practice, institutional record-keeping and computational reconstruction.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
The article aims to clarify what “practice-based research” is and how it can be judged as appropriate and acceptable doctoral research, particularly where creative practice and artefacts are central to the knowledge claim (p. 63). It further seeks to reduce definitional confusion that, in the authors’ view, has weakened the standing of practice-based approaches in the PhD (p. 64).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
This is a conceptual and position-setting paper, not an empirical study. Its method is argumentative synthesis: definitional analysis (practice vs research), comparative framing of adjacent terms (“practice as research”, “research as practice”, “practice-led research”), and illustrative exemplification via a curated set of doctoral cases supervised by Edmonds (pp. 64–68). Evidence is primarily (i) selective citations to canonical texts in practice research and (ii) the authors’ supervisory experience across arts, design and digital media programmes spanning c. 35 years (p. 63). The “sample” of cases (1980–2015) is explicitly not representative; it is presented as exemplars the authors can “vouch” for (p. 67).

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. Practice-based research requires a strict differentiation between “practice” (creative doing/making) and “research” (systematic, public, disseminated inquiry); conflation undermines doctoral claims to knowledge (p. 64).  
2. A practice-based PhD is distinguished by the inclusion of creative works as part of the submission; however, artefacts cannot “speak for themselves” and require a substantial written thesis for contextualisation, critical reflection and the articulation of originality (pp. 65–66).  
3. The artefact’s epistemic role is contentious because artistic “languages” are ambiguous and not universally agreed; therefore, practice-based research typically needs parallel linguistic framing (commentary/thesis) to render claims shareable and examinable (pp. 66–67).

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
The paper offers a doctoral-facing account of how practice becomes knowledge by passing through (a) making, (b) reflection/evaluation and (c) public dissemination and scrutiny (pp. 64–66). For a project concerned with epistemic drift across methods and records, Candy and Edmonds provide a mechanism-level explanation of where drift can be introduced: in the translation from artefact experience to textual argument, and in the documentation choices required to make work examinable (pp. 65–67).

## What the authors bring to the table
### Key contributions and claims
- **A disciplinary boundary claim:** practice-based research is not practice alone; research is public-facing, disseminated, original and contextualised (drawing on Biggs and Büchler’s criteria) (p. 64).  
- **A clarifying typology:** if the artefact is the basis of the contribution to knowledge, the work is practice-based; if the primary contribution is understanding practice, it is practice-led (pp. 64–65).  
- **A doctoral submission argument:** practice-based PhDs require artefact access (or high-quality documentation) plus a substantial thesis including aims, methods, outcomes and a critical “literature” review that positions novelty (pp. 65–66).  
- **A communicability thesis:** because interpretation of artefacts is inherently plural, practice-based research requires explicit norms/tests and linguistic framing to support justification and scrutiny (pp. 66–67).  
- **A pragmatic evidentiary move:** case examples demonstrate how practice and theory intertwine and how evaluation ranges from artist-centred judgement to participant-response evidence (pp. 67–68).

### How I respond to this evidence
- The argument is best treated as a normative framework for doctoral legitimacy rather than a descriptive account of how practice research always operates. Its value is as an examinable “minimum bar” for public knowledge claims (pp. 64–66).  
- The paper’s insistence on a public/private research distinction strengthens projects that must demonstrate shareable evidence trails (documentation, method, evaluation), but it risks under-theorising tacit and embodied knowledge that resists stable textualisation (pp. 64–67).  
- The practice-based/practice-led split is operationally useful for structuring a thesis, yet it can obscure hybrid projects where artefact and methodological insight co-produce the contribution (pp. 64–65).

## Positioning this work
### What this literature will do for my project
- Provide defensible language for separating practice activity from research claims, reducing category error in method chapters and viva preparation (p. 64).  
- Offer a thesis-architecture template: artefact experience/documentation + substantial writing (context, method, evaluation, originality) (pp. 65–66).  
- Supply a lens on “legibility” problems: ambiguity, translation and justification pressures that shape how creative knowledge is recorded and later interpreted (pp. 66–67).

### What this literature will not do
- It will not provide a systematic evidence base for assessment practices across institutions; its claims rest on selected literature and supervisory experience rather than comparative study (pp. 63, 67).  
- It will not resolve how to evaluate novelty when disciplinary norms are contested or when audiences hold divergent interpretive competencies (pp. 66–67).  
- It leaves under-specified how power, gatekeeping and archival infrastructures shape what counts as “public” research in practice disciplines, beyond gesturing to dissemination and scrutiny (pp. 64–66).

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- The insistence that doctoral practice research must yield *publicly scrutable* outcomes (disseminated, contextualised, open to challenge) supports an evidence-trail approach to practice documentation and archival design (p. 64).  
- The requirement that artefacts be experienced “as near as possible” (or documented at sufficient fidelity) identifies a critical site where institutional record-keeping can distort practice: what gets captured, at what resolution, and with what framing metadata (p. 65).  
- The discussion of ambiguity and the need for parallel linguistic framing clarifies why computational or visual-analytic reconstructions of practice records can amplify interpretive drift: they operate over already-mediated descriptions, not direct experience (pp. 66–67).  

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Strand 1 (historical emergence of practice research norms); Strand 2 (how practice is recorded/structured/obscured in doctoral submissions and archives); Strand 3 (how computational methods can reconstruct—or distort—practice-derived knowledge).  
- **Deliverables →** Definitions and decision rules for “practice-based” vs “practice-led”; a documentation protocol for artefact access and thesis–artefact linkage; a rubric for public knowledge claims in creative practice.  
- **Stakeholders →** Doctoral researchers; supervisors and examiners; institutional repositories/archivists; research offices defining regulations; audiences/participants in evaluation studies.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Clarity as intervention:** the paper directly targets definitional drift (“practice as research”/“research as practice”) and makes a forceful case that conceptual looseness devalues doctoral claims (p. 64).  
- **Doctoral practicality:** it specifies what examiners need (artefact access/documentation + thesis), turning abstract debates into submission requirements (pp. 65–66).  
- **Nuanced artefact account:** it recognises diverse artefact ontologies (objects, time-based works, performances, interactive systems) and uses Goodman’s notional/non-notional distinction to broaden what “artefact” can mean (p. 66).  
- **Evaluation gradient:** the cases show variation from artist-led judgement to participant-response evidence, resisting a single evaluation orthodoxy (pp. 67–68).

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Normative overreach:** the paper asserts what practice-based research *must* be, but offers limited engagement with alternative epistemologies that treat tacit, situated or relational knowing as primary rather than as a problem to be stabilised through text (pp. 64–67).  
- **Selective exemplification:** the case set centres on computational/digital and systems-oriented practices linked to Edmonds’s supervision; this risks overgeneralising from a particular lineage of practice research (pp. 67–68).  
- **Institutional politics underplayed:** the claim that lack of cohesive discourse hinders mainstream acceptance is plausible, but structural power (disciplinary hierarchies, funding regimes, repository standards) is not analysed (p. 65).  
- **Ambiguity treated instrumentally:** ambiguity is acknowledged as central to art, yet the proposed solution (linguistic framing) may reinscribe textual authority over non-textual knowledge, rather than treating ambiguity as a legitimate epistemic output (pp. 66–67).

### Author’s credibility
Both authors have extensive track records in creative practice research and doctoral supervision across art, design and digital media; the bios position Candy as a researcher in creativity/evaluation and Edmonds as a long-standing computational artist and editor/chair within key field institutions (p. 69). Credibility is strengthened by long involvement, but the article’s authority partly derives from that positionality, which can also narrow the viewpoint.

### Contextual validity
The arguments are most valid within doctoral regimes that require examinable submissions, stable records and public dissemination. Transferability to non-PhD practice contexts (community practice, non-institutional art worlds, indigenous knowledge traditions) is not established and should not be assumed (pp. 65–67).

### Comparisons
- The authors align with criteria-based approaches to practice research (Biggs and Büchler) in emphasising dissemination, originality and context (p. 64).  
- They resist formulations that collapse distinctions (“practice as research”), implicitly challenging strands within performance and artistic research that treat practice itself as epistemic proof (p. 64).  
- They adopt an iterative framing compatible with Smith and Dean’s practice-led/research-led cycle, but convert it into a doctoral accountability argument about contribution and examination (p. 64).

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Candy and Edmonds can be read as describing an “epistemic conversion pipeline”: lived practice → artefact → documentation/experience proxy → thesis framing → examinable knowledge claim (pp. 65–67). Each conversion step is a site for epistemic drift: the artefact’s dependence on context; documentation fidelity limits; and the thesis’s normative pressure to justify novelty in language. This suggests a productive analytical move for the project: treat doctoral practice research as an infrastructural system of representation, not merely a methodological choice.

### Critical thinking and rigour
The paper’s rigour is conceptual and procedural rather than empirical. It deploys definitional precision, boundary work (public vs personal research), and illustrative reasoning through cases (pp. 64–68). Its argumentation is intelligible and structured, but it relies on assertion and experience where a stronger contribution might have included comparative examination practices, assessor criteria in use, or failure cases where documentation and framing misrepresent practice (pp. 65–67).

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- 'Practice-based research is an original investigation ... partly by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice.' (p. 63)  
- 'Practice-based research is research and not practice alone.' (p. 68)  
- **Paraphrase:** A practice-based PhD must pair artefact access (or high-quality documentation) with substantial writing that contextualises, evidences originality and guides understanding of the work. (pp. 65–66)

## Questions for further research
- What assessment rubrics do examiners actually use for judging “original contribution” in practice-based PhDs, and how consistent are they across institutions and disciplines?  
- Which documentation practices most reliably preserve the experiential and contextual dimensions of artefacts (especially interactive, performance and installation work) (p. 65)?  
- How does the requirement for linguistic justification reshape what practitioners choose to make, document and claim as knowledge, and where does this introduce systematic epistemic drift (pp. 66–67)?  
- Under what conditions can ambiguity be treated as an epistemic output rather than a deficit to be corrected by text (pp. 66–67)?
