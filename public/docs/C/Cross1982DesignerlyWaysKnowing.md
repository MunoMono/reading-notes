# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** To ground “epistemic shift/shift” in a canonical account of design as a distinct knowledge culture, and to harvest stable descriptors that can become “testaments” in the DDR archive.  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Methods/history strand (S1): establishes the “designerly ways of knowing” frame that later lets me detect and evidence shift across texts, pedagogy, and archival records.  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** Cross gives a compact set of discriminators (phenomenon/methods/values; ill-defined problems; codes/object languages) that are easier to operationalise than broader “creativity/innovation” talk.  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will only use it where I can (a) page-cite specific “ways of knowing” claims and (b) map them to a DDR archival trace (catalogue language, teaching artefact, project record).  

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Cross (Open University; design research/education context) writes into early Design Studies debates about “design as a coherent discipline,” building on the RCA “Design in general education” work and Archer’s “third area.” The problem-space is legitimation: how design can be articulated as more than applied science or art, with its own methods and values.  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Treat “third culture” as a historically situated settlement (1980s UK design education politics) and test which parts persist as archival “testaments” versus which are period rhetoric.  

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to establish design as a coherent discipline by defining “designerly ways of knowing” distinct from sciences and humanities in order to justify design’s intrinsic value in general education.

## Lit review wiring (for copy/paste)
- **Lit review role:** Canonical baseline (S1) for “designerly knowing” as an epistemic culture (a dated benchmark for shift).
- **1 sentence to paste into lit review:** Cross (1982) frames design as a distinct epistemic culture with its own phenomenon, methods, and values—so claims about modelling, solution-focused synthesis under wickedness, and “codes/object languages” can be treated as page-cited baseline “testaments” against which later archival descriptions and practices can be compared for shift.

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Design is a distinct “third area/culture” with its own phenomenon, methods, and values; at its core is modelling and the conception/realisation of new things.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Cross summarises the RCA report: design concerns “the conception and realization of new things,” has a “language” of modelling, and has “its own distinct ‘things to know, ways of knowing them, and ways of finding out about them.’” He contrasts cultures by phenomenon (man-made world), methods (modelling/pattern-formation/synthesis), and values (practicality/ingenuity/empathy/appropriateness). ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 221–222]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If design is defined by distinct object of study + inquiry methods + value orientation, it can be treated as a knowledge culture (not a derivative of science/humanities).
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** Cross provides an early, canonical articulation of design as a separate epistemic culture; this gives me stable descriptors I can treat as “testaments” when tracking shift in how DDR materials frame design knowledge.
- **Practice cross-check:** See **Archive hook (one)** below — TODO (add DDR record IDs).

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** A designerly mode of inquiry is solution-focused synthesis (often “satisficing”) suited to ill-defined/wicked problems, where proposing a solution helps define the problem.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Cross reports Lawson’s experiments: scientists were “problem-focused,” architects “solution-focused,” learning about the problem “as a result of trying out solutions.” He links this to design’s “ill-defined, ill-structured, or ‘wicked’” problems, argues exhaustive analysis can’t guarantee correctness, and says “it is only in terms of a conjectured solution that the problem can be contained within manageable bounds,” via a “primary generator” that defines limits and suggests solution direction. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 223–224]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If the class of problems is inherently underdetermined, then solution-generation is not a shortcut but an epistemic strategy (a way of knowing).
- **So what for my thesis:** This gives me a historically grounded account of “designerly” epistemic practice (solution-first; primary generator) that I can look for as a shift marker in DDR project documentation and teaching artefacts.
- **Practice cross-check:** See **Archive hook (one)** below — TODO (add DDR record IDs).

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** Designerly knowledge also lives in nonverbal “codes” and in objects/material culture; designers “read and write” object languages, and these capacities justify design’s intrinsic educational value.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Cross argues design involves “pattern synthesis” and “codes” translating between abstract requirements and concrete artefacts; designers learn to “speak” this code (Hillier & Leaman). He then claims knowledge is “carried in the objects of our material culture,” and designers can “read” and “write” in this culture. He culminates in five aspects of designerly knowing (ill-defined problems; solution-focused; constructive thinking; codes translating requirements→objects; reading/writing object languages). ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 224–226]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If knowledge is embedded in artefacts + translation codes, then archives of artefacts, descriptions, and models are not secondary: they are epistemic evidence.
- **So what for my thesis:** Cross gives a direct bridge from epistemic claims to archival traces: “codes,” models, and object languages are exactly the kinds of records the DDR archive can surface as “testaments” of epistemic shift.
- **Practice cross-check:** See **Archive hook (one)** below — TODO (add DDR record IDs).

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Designerly ways of knowing:** distinct ways of knowing tied to design as a “third area,” including modelling/pattern formation/synthesis and value orientation to appropriateness. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 221–222]``
- **Ill-defined / wicked problems:** design problems where full information can’t be available; not susceptible to exhaustive analysis; no guaranteed “correct” solutions. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 224]``
- **Satisficing:** producing a satisfactory solution rather than optimising; pragmatic closure under constraints. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 224]``
- **Primary generator:** an imposed/selected starting principle that bounds the problem and suggests the solution direction. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 224]``
- **Codes / object languages:** learned translation systems that map abstract requirements ↔ concrete artefacts; enable “read/write” in material culture. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 224–226]``

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A compact, operational set of “designerly” discriminators (phenomenon/method/value + five aspects) I can turn into archive-facing evidence prompts. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 221–226]``
  - A historically grounded account of why design’s epistemic style is solution-focused under wickedness/constraint. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 223–224]``
  - The key bridge for my project: knowledge in objects/codes means DDR records are epistemic material, not just “outputs.” ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 224–226]``
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - Use “designerly ways of knowing” as a testable checklist against DDR traces (language of modelling, ordering principles, codes, read/write in material culture), rather than as a slogan about a “third culture.”
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What does “code” look like in DDR archival description (catalogue fields, controlled vocabularies, classification schemes), and how does it shift across time? ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 224–226]``

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Chapter/section defining epistemic shift markers in design research traditions (S1): use Cross to define candidate “testaments” (modelling; solution-focus; codes/object languages).
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention: *Designerly Ways of Knowing* (Cross 1982). Then “Cross (1982)” thereafter.
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** See **Archive hook (one)** below — TODO (add DDR record IDs).
- **Workstreams →** DDR archive activation; epistemic shift markers; evidence-chain method
- **Deliverables →** shift marker checklist; annotated exemplar record; methods write-up (S1)
- **Stakeholders →** RCA DDR archive users; archivists/metadata stewards; design research readers

## Archive hook (one)
**Use this once (not three times): pick ONE DDR record set and test all three claims against it.**
- **Hook question:** Which DDR record(s) function as “testamentary traces” of *designerly knowing* (modelling, solution-first synthesis, codes/object languages)?
- **What to look for in DDR (attach archive IDs):**
  1) **Modelling / appropriateness / man-made world language** in catalogue description, briefs, or teaching notes (Claim 1).
  2) **Primary generator equivalents**: early bounding moves, ordering principles, first sketches/diagrams that reframe the problem (Claim 2).
  3) **Codes / object languages**: diagrams, notation systems, classification terms, translation between requirement → artefact (Claim 3).
- **Output to write (1 sentence):** “In DDR record(s) ___, the ‘testament’ appears as ___ (field/artefact), which supports/complicates Cross’s claim ___ and shows shift when compared to ___ (later record/standard/edition).”
- **TODO:** Add DDR record IDs: ___

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** This paper is a high-level disciplinary justification; it offers discriminators and exemplars but not a method for archival measurement or reconstruction. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 221–226]``
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I treat “designerly” as timeless essence, I’ll erase shift; I must use it as a dated baseline to compare against DDR traces, not as a definition that ends debate. ``[@Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing, p. 221–226]``
