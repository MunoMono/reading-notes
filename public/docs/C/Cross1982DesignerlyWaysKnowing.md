# Scope of this note
This note concentrates on Cross’s argument that design constitutes a “third culture” with distinctive epistemic practices, and on his attempt to justify design within general education by specifying “designerly ways of knowing”. It is read as a canonical hinge-text for the PhD’s concern with how epistemic drift becomes visible across design methods, institutional records, and computational reconstruction, because Cross frames design knowledge as (a) code-like, (b) materially mediated, and (c) often tacit yet teachable. (pp. 221–226)

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Cross aims to establish theoretical bases for treating design as a coherent discipline of study, by clarifying what is distinctive about design as knowledge and practice and by arguing for its legitimate place in general education. His central objective is to articulate intrinsic educational value in design (beyond vocational training) by specifying “designerly ways of knowing” and linking these to cognitive and curricular criteria. (pp. 221–226)

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
This is a conceptual and argumentative paper (not an empirical study), structured as:
- **Comparative framing** of three “cultures” (sciences, humanities, design/technology) across phenomenon of study, methods, and values, used as an analytic device to define design by contrast. (pp. 221–222)
- **Philosophical grounding** via Peters’s criteria for what counts as “education”, used as an evaluative framework for whether design can claim parity in general education. (pp. 222–223)
- **Synthesis of design-research evidence** drawn from prior observational/experimental studies (eg Lawson; Eastman; Levin; Marples) to characterise design cognition and problem-solving. The “sample” is therefore secondary: Cross selectively curates examples rather than reporting new data. (pp. 223–225)
- **Normative educational argument** that infers curricular implications from the above synthesis, culminating in a call for a Lakatosian “research programme” for design-as-discipline. (pp. 226–227)

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Design is framed as a neglected third area of human knowledge** concerned with the man-made world, distinguished by methods of modelling/pattern-formation/synthesis and values oriented to practicality, ingenuity, empathy, and “appropriateness”. This framing is presented as a corrective to the dominance of sciences/humanities (“two cultures”). (pp. 221–222)  
2. **“Designerly ways of knowing” are specified as a coherent epistemic bundle**, including ill-defined (“wicked”) problems, solution-focused strategies (“satisficing”), constructive (rather than analytic) reasoning, and the use of codes that translate between abstract requirements and concrete artefacts. Cross stresses that such knowledge is often tacit, which shapes pedagogy and motivates the need for greater articulation. (pp. 223–226)  
3. **Design’s legitimacy in general education depends on intrinsic value**, not vocational instrumentality. Cross argues that design education can be justified because it develops capacities for real-world ill-defined problem-solving, sustains concrete/iconic cognition, and cultivates non-verbal thought and communication (graphicacy, modelling, “object languages”). (pp. 222–226)

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
For a PhD focused on epistemic drift becoming observable across design methods, institutional archives, and multimodal computational reconstruction, Cross offers three directly reusable premises:
- **Epistemic practices are materially and semiotically mediated**: design knowledge operates through models, sketches, diagrams and “codes” that translate between domains (needs ↔ artefacts). This provides an early account of how knowledge becomes externalised in forms that can later be archived, standardised, and computationally re-analysed. (pp. 224–226)
- **Design problems are structurally drift-prone**: if problems are ill-defined and partly constituted through conjectured solutions, then “what the problem is” can legitimately change as work proceeds—an engine for conceptual drift within methods and projects. (pp. 224–225)
- **Tacit-to-explicit translation is a disciplinary project**: Cross’s insistence on externalising tacit knowledge anticipates methodological tensions central to computational reconstruction (what gets formalised, what gets lost, what becomes legible). (pp. 224–226)

## What the authors bring to the table
### Key contributions and claims
- **A disciplinary claim**: design warrants parity with sciences/humanities because it has distinctive phenomena, methods, and values. (pp. 221–222)
- **A cognitive-epistemic claim**: designers characteristically proceed via solution-focused, constructive synthesis and satisficing, suited to wicked problems. (pp. 223–225)
- **A representational claim**: designerly knowing is embodied in “codes” and “object languages” that enable reading/writing the material culture; objects themselves store knowledge and precede theory. (pp. 224–225)
- **A pedagogic claim**: design in general education must be justified intrinsically and should develop neglected non-verbal cognition and communication. (pp. 225–226)
- **A programme claim**: design requires a Lakatosian “research programme” to consolidate design-as-discipline, with “designerly ways of knowing” as a touchstone idea. (p. 226)

## How the PhD project responds to this evidence
- **Building on**: The PhD can treat Cross’s “codes” and material representations as early statements of *knowledge infrastructures* in design, aligning them to later archival and computational concerns (how inscriptions stabilise, travel, and distort). (pp. 224–226)
- **Challenging**: The PhD can test Cross’s tripartite “cultures” framing against institutional realities in which design is entangled with science/humanities, and examine whether “designerly” is a stable category or itself a site of drift. (pp. 221–222)
- **Extending**: Cross’s call to externalise tacit codes can be reframed as a methodological problem: externalisation may produce epistemic gains (legibility) while also introducing loss, bias, and infrastructural drift—precisely the PhD’s terrain. (pp. 224–226)

## Positioning this work
### What this literature will do for my project
- **Provides canonical vocabulary** for distinguishing design knowledge (ill-defined problems; solution focus; constructive reasoning; codes/object languages) that can scaffold the PhD’s conceptual apparatus for epistemic drift within design methods. (pp. 224–226)
- **Supplies an education-to-research bridge**: Cross explicitly links design education and design research as converging pathways towards a discipline, which supports a historiographic strand tracing how methods discourse stabilises over time (and where it drifts). (pp. 226–227)
- **Establishes material-semiotic stakes**: by treating objects and representations as carriers of knowledge, Cross legitimises analysing archives and inscriptions as epistemic actors rather than neutral containers. (p. 225)

### What this literature will not do
- **It will not supply primary empirical evidence** for contemporary design practice: its “findings” rely on selective secondary studies and mid-century cognitive/educational theory, so claims require re-validation under current conditions. (pp. 223–226)
- **It will not operationalise measurement**: Cross names “codes” and “deep structure” but does not specify analytic methods for identifying them; the PhD must develop operational proxies (eg representational features, archival schemas, computational embeddings). (pp. 224–225)
- **It will not address institutional power explicitly**: although it gestures at education systems and neglect, it largely treats curriculum as a cognitive issue rather than an institutional-political one; drift in record-keeping and governance must be sourced elsewhere. (pp. 222–226)

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- **Defines the mechanism by which drift can occur within method**: ill-defined problems and problem redefinition mean the “object” of knowledge can shift during inquiry; drift is not merely error but a structural feature of design problem-solving. (pp. 224–225)
- **Identifies where drift becomes materially recordable**: models, diagrams, sketches and object languages are the “codes” through which abstract requirements are translated into artefacts; these inscriptions are precisely the traces institutional archives later retain, structure, and sometimes obscure. (pp. 224–226)
- **Justifies multimodal analysis epistemically**: by claiming design relies on non-verbal cognition and communication, Cross legitimises analysing visual/graphic and object-level data (not only text) in computational reconstruction and visual analytics. (pp. 225–226)

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Strand 1 (historical emergence of epistemic drift in design research discourse); Strand 2 (where drift is materially recorded/structured/obscured in archives and curricula); Strand 3 (reconstruction via multimodal ML and visual analytics, grounded in non-verbal “codes”). (pp. 225–227)  
- **Deliverables →** conceptual framework chapter on designerly epistemics; coding/annotation schema for design representations (sketch/model/object); methodological rationale for multimodal evidence in the thesis. (pp. 224–226)  
- **Stakeholders →** RCA supervisory team; institutional archivists/records managers; design educators; computational collaborators (ML/visual analytics) who require a defensible epistemic rationale for multimodal data. (pp. 225–227)

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Disciplinary consolidation**: Cross provides a compact, teachable set of claims that make “design epistemology” speakable within the academy, which helps stabilise a field often described as conceptually diffuse. (pp. 221–226)
- **Productive linkage of education and research**: the paper treats pedagogy not as downstream application but as a site where epistemic commitments become explicit and contestable. (pp. 222–227)
- **Material and representational sensitivity**: by foregrounding non-verbal codes, modelling, and artefacts as knowledge carriers, Cross anticipates later work on inscriptions and visual knowledge (even if not named as such here). (pp. 224–226)

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Over-neat tripartite taxonomy**: the “three cultures” framing risks reifying boundaries and underplaying hybrid practices (eg scientific design research; humanities-inflected speculative design). It functions rhetorically, but its analytic precision is limited. (pp. 221–222)
- **Selective evidence base**: design cognition is supported mainly through curated references (especially Lawson) rather than a systematic review; alternative accounts of design reasoning are not engaged. (pp. 223–225)
- **Cognitive claims show period effects**: the appeal to hemispheric dominance and stage/continuous debates is historically situated; parts may read as dated and should be treated as indicative rather than definitive. (p. 226]
- *)Normativity without institutional analysis**: the argument for intrinsic educational value is philosophically grounded, but the paper says little about political economy, professional regulation, or institutional power—factors that strongly shape what counts as “design knowledge” and how it is recorded. (pp. 222–226)

### Author’s credibility
Cross writes as “Design Discipline” at The Open University, positioning himself within a then-emergent institutional effort to treat design as a coherent discipline. The paper signals deep familiarity with contemporary design-methods discourse and design-education debates, but it also reflects a field still establishing its scholarly conventions. (p. 221)

### Contextual validity
The claims generalise at the level of *ideal-typical* design practice rather than a specific empirical context. Where the paper is strongest is in specifying tendencies (ill-defined problems; satisficing; constructive reasoning) that plausibly recur across domains, but the absence of primary data means generalisability remains an argument, not a demonstrated result. (pp. 223–226)

### Comparisons
- Aligns with “wicked problems” framing by citing Rittel & Webber and arguing that solution-focused strategies are rational responses to ill-structured tasks. (pp. 224–225)
- Sits close to Simon’s distinction between how things are and how they ought to be, adopting satisficing as a design-appropriate rationality. (pp. 224–225)
- Extends Archer’s “three Rs” argument by specifying epistemic content (codes/object languages) rather than only curricular advocacy. (pp. 221–222)

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- **Drift as a feature, not a bug**: Cross implies that design’s epistemic object is dynamically stabilised through conjectured solutions; problem definition is not prior to method but co-produced by it. This can be read as an early account of epistemic drift internal to design practice, with implications for how archives later freeze particular “versions” of the problem. (pp. 224–225)
- **Representations as drift vectors**: if design relies on codes translating needs ↔ artefacts, then the representational chain (briefs, sketches, models, specifications, objects) is a likely site where meaning shifts—through compression, standardisation, or institutional formatting. Cross’s call to externalise tacit codes can be reframed as attention to where translations introduce slippage. (pp. 224–226)
- **Multimodal reconstruction is epistemically necessary**: Cross’s emphasis on non-verbal thought strengthens the case that computational methods limited to text will systematically misread design knowledge; multimodal ML and visual analytics are not optional add-ons but appropriate responses to the material-semiotic character of design knowing. (pp. 225–226)

### Critical thinking and rigour
Cross employs a recognisable critical toolkit: definitional contrast (three cultures), philosophical criteria (Peters), and triangulation with design-research exemplars (Lawson, Simon, Alexander). Argumentation is coherent and cumulative, but rigour is uneven: empirical claims rely on secondary studies; conceptual categories sometimes function as persuasive simplifications; and several cognitive-psychology references are asserted more than interrogated. The prose is largely clear and pedagogically oriented, though the central term “code” remains under-specified, leaving operational questions to later work. (pp. 221–226)

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase

-)'It is only in terms of a conjectured solution that the problem can be contained within manageable bounds.' (p. 224) (p. 224)
-)**Paraphrase:** Cross argues that designerly knowing relies on non-verbal “codes” that translate between abstract requirements and concrete objects, enabling both constructive thinking and communication. (pp. 225–226) (pp. 225–226)

## Questions for further research
- How can “design codes” be operationalised for analysis (eg as features of sketches, models, briefs, or archival schemas) without flattening tacit judgement? (pp. 224–225)  
- Under what institutional conditions does externalising tacit knowledge reduce drift (shared standards) versus amplify drift (bureaucratic simplification and loss)? (pp. 224–226)  
- What counts as “non-verbal evidence” in computational reconstruction of design knowledge, and how can multimodal models avoid reproducing the biases of the archival record? (pp. 225–226)  
- If ill-defined problems are co-constructed through solutions, what should be treated as the unit of analysis for “epistemic drift”: the brief, the representational chain, the artefact, or the institutional file? (pp. 224–225)
