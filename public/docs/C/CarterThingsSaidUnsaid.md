# Scope of this note
Whole article (Archivaria 61, pp. 215–234). Treated here as a core theoretical text on **archival silence** that complements Harris’s “archival sliver” by distinguishing *silence imposed by power* from *silence chosen as resistance*, and by outlining how archivists can read and act around these gaps.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Carter asks:

- **How do silences operate in and around archives?**
- **In what ways are silences produced by the powerful, and with what consequences for marginalised groups’ memory, history and accountability?**
- **How might archivists and researchers both contest imposed silences and respect silence as a strategy of resistance?**

The paper aims to theorise archival silence as a complex phenomenon: at once a product of exclusionary power and a possible resource for marginalised groups, and to sketch practical and ethical implications for archivists (pp. 215–217).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

- **Conceptual, argumentative essay** grounded in archival theory, feminist rhetoric and philosophy.
- Draws on:
  - Archival literature (Harris, Schwartz & Cook, Millar, Samuels, Duranti, Duff & Harris).
  - Critical theory (Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Nora).
  - Feminist work on silence, power and rhetoric (Rich, Hedges & Fishkin, Meyerhoff, Lawrence, Ratcliffe, Glenn, Cooper, Mahoney, Fivush).
  - Case examples around marginalised communities, citizen–state interactions, and community archives (e.g. Canadian Women’s Movement Archives, Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives).  
- No empirical dataset or sampling; evidence is textual and theoretical, with occasional historical references (pp. 215–218, 220–222).

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Archives are spaces of power; silences are intrinsic, not accidental.**  
   - Carter rejects the idea of neutral archives, arguing that archival power is “in part, the power to allow voices to be heard,” through inclusion and highlighting of certain narratives, but equally “the power to exclude” (p. 216).  
   - Distortions, omissions and silences are inevitable: not every story can be told, even in “total archives” regimes (pp. 215–217).

2. **Silence imposed from above damages social memory, identity and accountability.**  
   - “Silences haunt every archives” (p. 217). The powerful (state, dominant social groups) exercise “power over” by controlling resources and information, creating “simple and perfect” silences where dissenters are gagged or threatened out of the language game (pp. 218–219).  
   - Silencing also occurs when marginalised speech lacks authority and is not recognised as a record, especially for groups with non-textual recordkeeping traditions (e.g. oral traditions) (pp. 219–220).  
   - Drawing on Nora, Schwartz & Cook and Harris, Carter argues that archives are crucial to social memory; when groups are missing from archives, their histories, identities and ability to seek redress are compromised (pp. 220–222).  
   - He connects archival silences to Lyotard’s “differend”: without records, plaintiffs are divested of the means to argue their case (p. 222).

3. **Silences can be “read” and partially subverted, but filling them is ethically fraught.**  
   - Because speech and silence are mutually defining, “what is present in the archives is defined by what is not” (p. 223).  
   - Strategies include “listening to silences” from feminist criticism, reading “against the grain” and Foucauldian archaeology to interrogate omissions and discontinuities (pp. 223–224).  
   - Citizen–state interactions (prisons, hospitals, residential schools, ghettos, camps) are particularly rich sites where the oppressed appear in the state’s own records of repression; totalitarian regimes’ “good record-keeping” paradoxically preserves marginal voices (pp. 224–225).  
   - Archivists may feel compelled to “fill the gaps” through documentation strategies, intervening in record-creation or creating records themselves (pp. 225–226). Carter warns this may misrepresent communities, overwrite preferred fragmentariness, or recentre archivists’ subjectivities; archivists risk further marginalising those they aim to help (pp. 226–227).

4. **Silence can be chosen and wielded as power by the marginalised.**  
   - Using feminist rhetorical theory, Carter distinguishes “unnatural” silences (imposed by power) from “natural” silences willingly entered into (p. 228).  
   - For some women and other marginalised groups, silence is a deliberate strategy of resistance and self-assertion—“a plan, rigorously executed” in Adrienne Rich’s terms—rather than absence of language (pp. 215–216, 227–229).  
   - Silence is framed as “power with” or “power to” (capacity and autonomy), not only “power over” (pp. 227–228].  
   - Carter notes that archivists must combat imposed, unnatural silences (including those masking oppression or wrongdoing) but respect natural, resistant silences; deciding which is which demands investigation and dialogue guided by justice (pp. 228–229).

5. **Communities can and do build their own archives; mainstream archivists must both contest and accept silence.**  
   - Carter highlights community archives such as the **Canadian Women’s Movement Archives** and **Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives**, founded because public archives had failed to preserve social-change movements; both explicitly frame themselves as responses to “a conspiracy of silence” (pp. 232–233).  
   - Mainstream archivists, he argues, should:  
     - Expose silences and injustices by reading against the grain and creating finding aids, exhibitions and “liberatory descriptive standards” that foreground marginal records (pp. 223–224, 231–232).  
     - Invite communities into planning and governance, and support independent archives via expertise and funding (pp. 231–233).  
     - Recognise that “defining the archive limits and silences” and that some groups will choose to remain outside; archivists must therefore “not undermine the right of groups to keep their own silence” (p. 233).

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

For the thesis:

- Carter provides a **granular taxonomy of silence**: imposed vs chosen, simple/perfect silences, unrecognised speech acts, “natural” vs “unnatural” silences. This helps refine the category of **missingness** beyond simple absence.
- He links archival silence to **social memory, identity and accountability**, giving a direct line from DDR’s missing records to questions of who can narrate DDR’s history and contest decisions.
- His caution about archivists speaking for others informs the project’s design ethics: DDR’s computational reconstructions must avoid assuming that every gap is a failure to be patched; some absences may be historically or politically significant, or even deliberately maintained.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Clarifies where silence comes from.**  
  Carter identifies silences arising from state repression, epistemic non-recognition (e.g. oral traditions), resource constraints and appraisal decisions (pp. 218–220). This supports a layered analysis of DDR’s gaps: which are structural, which are contingent, which reflect non-recognised practices.

- **Connects missingness to identity and redress.**  
  The link he draws between archival silence, impaired collective memory and reduced capacity to seek accountability (pp. 220–222) can be used to argue why DDR’s reconstruction matters: not just for historiography, but for institutional self-understanding and critique.

- **Warns against over-zealous “gap filling.”**  
  Carter’s critique of documentation strategies and archivist-created records (pp. 225–227) gives a theoretical basis for a *document-and-flag* approach in DDR (marking gaps, uncertain reconstructions, and known silences) rather than silently smoothing them away.

- **Legitimises community-controlled archives and independent infrastructures.**  
  The examples of CWMA and CLGA show how marginalised groups build their own archives when state archives fail them (pp. 232–233). This resonates with treating DDR as one node in a wider ecology of design-research memory, not as sole authority.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths

- **Nuanced account of silence.**  
  Carter moves beyond seeing silence as mere lack, unpacking multiple forms and sources, and introducing the idea of silence as *power to* (capacity, resistance) as well as *power over* (pp. 218–219, 227–229).
- **Strong linkage of theory and archival practice.**  
  The essay weaves Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard and feminist theory with concrete archival strategies (documentation, outreach, description, community archives) (pp. 220–226, 231–233).
- **Ethical sophistication.**  
  It insists on respecting communities that choose silence and cautions against archivists speaking on others’ behalf, anticipating contemporary debates on consent and data sovereignty (pp. 226–229, 233).

### Weaknesses and limitations

- **Little empirical grounding.**  
  Aside from a few example archives, the argument is primarily theoretical; there is no systematic empirical study of how particular communities experience silence.
- **Primarily analogue and textual focus.**  
  Digital infrastructures, automation and AI are not discussed; silence in born-digital and computational systems has to be extrapolated.
- **Ambiguity in operational decisions.**  
  While Carter calls for archivists to distinguish natural from unnatural silences, he acknowledges the difficulty; practical decision criteria remain under-specified (pp. 228–229).

### Author’s credibility

Carter is a Canadian archivist writing in *Archivaria*, a key journal in archival theory. His argument is embedded in the “archives, records and power” paradigm and engages extensively with leading figures (Harris, Schwartz & Cook, Nora, Derrida), positioning him as a serious participant in that discourse (pp. 215–217, 220–221).

### Contextual validity

- The immediate context is Canadian/north American archival practice, but the mechanisms he describes (state dominance, epistemic exclusion, feminist silence) generalise to other institutional archives.
- The specific examples (CWMA, CLGA) are local, yet they illustrate patterns of community archives and “patriarchal archives” that apply more widely.

### Comparisons

- **With Harris (2002).**  
  Harris’s “archival sliver” emphasises structural partiality and justice; Carter focuses more explicitly on the dynamics of silence and on silence as a deliberate community strategy.
- **With Moss & Thomas (Archival Silences).**  
  Carter provides an earlier, tightly argued articulation of silence that the later edited volume extends and diversifies.
- **With Gilliland & Caswell (imaginaries).**  
  Gilliland & Caswell foreground imagination and world-making; Carter foregrounds silence and resistance. Together they frame DDR both as world-making and as structured silence.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights

For DDR:

- Carter encourages treating **every gap as a question**: is it the product of institutional power, technical limits, or a deliberate choice by actors not to be recorded? The DDR schema and database can embody this by differentiating “unknown”, “not applicable”, “not collected”, “deliberately withheld”, etc.
- His discussion of **reading against the grain** suggests that DDR RAG should not merely index what exists, but surface contextual signals of absence: e.g. highlighting documentation practices, appraisal policies, and known blind spots.
- The distinction between natural/unnatural silence is useful when thinking about **consent and data reuse**: just because DDR can be digitised and linked does not mean every conceivable linkage is ethically appropriate.

### Alternative explanations?

One could argue that most archival silence in a setting like DDR is accidental (space, staffing). Carter’s layered account—combining resource constraints with structural power and epistemic non-recognition—supports a more cautious reading: even mundane gaps are likely patterned by institutional priorities and worldviews (pp. 219–222).

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?

- **Practice:** implement metadata fields in DDR that capture reasons for absence where known; develop guidance for when *not* to chase or display information (respecting natural silences).
- **Policy:** create avenues for communities connected to DDR (staff, alumni, collaborators) to negotiate how and whether their records are included, echoing Carter’s emphasis on invitation rather than assumption.
- **Theory:** position DDR as a site where **silence and speech co-constitute archival meaning**, aligning with Carter’s absent-presence notion.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase

- “Silences haunt every archives. Silence, however, can be contested and the marginalized can be invited in, although it must be recognized that these groups may not accept this invitation.” (p. 217).  
- “Archival power is, in part, the power to allow voices to be heard… The power to exclude is a fundamental aspect of the archive.” (p. 216).  
- **Paraphrase:** Carter argues that when archives are impaired by silences, collective memory is likewise impaired; marginalised groups whose records are missing struggle to narrate their history, form identity or seek redress for wrongs (pp. 220–222).  
- “Silence implies voice… Silence can be actively entered into or, as occurs where the power is exerted over an individual or group, it is enacted upon that individual or group.” (p. 220).  
- **Paraphrase:** Drawing on feminist theory, he distinguishes “natural” silences chosen for reflection and resistance from “unnatural” silences imposed by power; archivists should combat the latter but respect the former (pp. 228–229).  
- “Defining the archive limits and silences… Archivists have the ability to highlight the contestation of social memory, disclose the absences… and do our best to offer them a place, if they would have it… It is essential that archivists not undermine the right of groups to keep their own silence.” (p. 233).

## Questions for further research

- How might **Carter’s taxonomy of silences** be operationalised in DDR’s data model (e.g. codes for imposed vs chosen silences, or for epistemic non-recognition)?
- What methods can identify traces of currently absent groups in DDR (e.g. reading administrative records against the grain, examining “citizen–institution” interactions)?
- How should DDR handle requests from individuals or communities who *wish* to remain silent or unrepresented in future digital systems?
- Could DDR support or interoperate with **community-led archives** of design research that sit outside institutional control, in line with Carter’s examples?
