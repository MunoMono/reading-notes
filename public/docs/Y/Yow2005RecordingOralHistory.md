This note treats the second edition of Valerie Raleigh Yow’s *Recording Oral History: A Guide for the Humanities and Social Sciences* as a whole, with particular emphasis on the chapters that define oral history, address memory, ethics and power, and specify project design, interviewing, analysis and interpretation. The focus is on extracting a robust method spine and conceptual vocabulary for an oral-history strand within an institutionally focused, design-led project.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Yow does not advance a single empirical research question; instead she addresses a methodological and epistemological problem: how can oral history, understood as recorded, in-depth, often life-history interviewing, be conducted, analysed and presented in ways that are both ethically responsible and historiographically rigorous [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory]?

The primary objectives are:
- to codify good practice in planning, conducting and archiving oral history interviews across the humanities and social sciences;
- to clarify what kind of knowledge oral history produces, given the subjectivity and reconstructive character of memory;
- to integrate ethical, legal and emotional considerations into method rather than treating them as afterthoughts;
- to provide a pedagogical guide that supports both novice and experienced practitioners in reflecting on their own positionality and practice [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

The book is a methods handbook, not a single empirical study, so its “methodology” consists of synthesis and critical reflection rather than a discrete research design.

- **Mode of inquiry.** Yow synthesises psychological, sociological, anthropological and historical research on memory, narrative and interviewing; draws on institutional guidelines (such as the Oral History Association’s evaluation standards); and uses case vignettes from her own and others’ projects to exemplify practice [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].
- **Core method.** The central technique is the in-depth, semi-structured interview, often biographical or life-history in orientation. Yow details preparation (project conceptualisation, sampling, recruitment, interview guides, equipment), conduct (building rapport, asking open and follow-up questions, managing emotion, negotiating power), and closure (debriefing, follow-up, archiving) [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].
- **Sampling.** There is no fixed sample size; instead Yow describes strategic sampling tailored to the research question (for example, purposive sampling for key actors, maximum-variation sampling for community studies) and discusses saturation as a practical judgement rather than a formal threshold.
- **Analytic approaches.** Yow reviews diverse analytic options: thematic coding and comparative analysis; narrative and life-story analysis; psycho-social and interpretive readings; and triangulation with documentary and quantitative sources [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory]. She advocates methodological pluralism anchored in documentation (face sheets, logs, indexes) and reflexivity about the interviewer’s role.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Oral history is a co-constructed, subjective narrative form.**

   Yow’s first major claim is that oral history interviews do not simply extract facts from narrators but co-construct narratives shaped by the interaction between interviewer and interviewee, by the interview context, and by wider cultural narratives [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory]. Subjectivity is not a contamination to be removed but the very material of analysis. The interview becomes a site where memory, identity and meaning-making are performed.

   She positions oral history as distinct from, yet complementary to, survey research and ethnographic observation. Compared with surveys, oral history allows narrators to define what matters and to sequence their own accounts. Compared with participant observation, interviews produce focused retrospective reflection and explicit commentary on experience [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].

2. **Memory is interpretive, patterned and socially framed, not a literal record.**

   Yow devotes substantial attention to psychological and sociological work on memory to argue that recall is reconstructive, selective and meaning-driven. Autobiographical memories are shaped by present identities, emotions and social relationships; they are also influenced by public discourses and collective memory regimes [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].

   She distinguishes:
   - everyday memories versus singular, highly emotional events;
   - individual memory versus collective, official and popular memories;
   - the particular dynamics of traumatic memories, which may be fragmentary and non-linear [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].

   For oral historians this means that inconsistencies, silences and narrative shifts are not simply “errors” but clues to how people understand their lives and worlds. Triangulation with other sources is necessary, but divergence can be analytically productive rather than merely problematic.

3. **Ethics, power and project design are central to methodological rigour.**

   A third key argument is that rigour in oral history is as much ethical and interpersonal as technical. Yow emphasises that project design, the choice and sequencing of questions, and decisions about recording, archiving and dissemination are all laden with ethical and political implications [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].

   She:
   - addresses legal issues (copyright, libel, privacy, deposit and release forms) and stresses the long-term implications of archiving for narrators and their families;
   - analyses power imbalances between interviewer and narrator, including differences of gender, race, class, age and institutional position, and their effects on rapport and disclosure;
   - highlights the emotional labour involved for both parties, especially in projects dealing with trauma, conflict or intimate family histories, and recommends strategies for handling distress and maintaining trust [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].

   Yow extends these considerations across project types—community studies, institutional histories, biographies and family research—showing how sampling, question design and interpretation must adapt to each context.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

Yow’s handbook underpins the oral-history strand of the project at three levels:

- **Conceptual.** Her treatment of oral history as co-constructed, subjective and situated provides a conceptual frame for treating interviews not as neutral supplements to archives but as sites where institutional narratives are negotiated and contested [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory]. This aligns with a broader interest in epistemic drift and the designerly construction of “what happened”.
- **Methodological.** Her detailed guidance on project design, recruitment, interviewing, transcription, indexing and archiving offers a procedural template for building a robust, reusable oral history workflow within the project’s methods spine [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].
- **Ethical and infrastructural.** Yow’s insistence that ethics, power and emotional labour are integral to method speaks directly to the project’s requirement to design a sustainable, responsible infrastructure for recording, storing and re-using oral histories in digital and computational contexts [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- **Legitimises oral history as a primary research method.** Yow explicitly frames oral history as a rigorous qualitative method that can stand alongside documentary and quantitative sources, rather than mere anecdotal illustration [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory]. This supports the project’s decision to treat interviews with former institutional actors as core evidence rather than decorative context.
- **Supplies a template for project and interview design.** Her chapters on defining topics, selecting narrators, crafting interview guides and planning fieldwork offer stepwise procedures that can be translated into project protocols and checklists [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory]. These can structure workplans and ethics applications for the project’s oral-history strand.
- **Specifies metadata and provenance requirements.** Yow’s insistence on face sheets, contextual notes, interviewer reflections, and clear records of consent and restrictions maps directly onto the project’s need for rich metadata to support later computational analysis and responsible re-use [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].
- **Clarifies how to triangulate oral testimony with institutional archives.** Her discussion of comparing interviews with written sources—treating convergences and divergences as analytically meaningful rather than simply right or wrong—offers a methodological basis for integrating oral histories with institutional records, design artefacts and quantitative traces [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].
- **Foregrounds ethics and power as design constraints.** The detailed treatment of consent, confidentiality, emotional risk and power asymmetries can be translated into design constraints for the project’s workflows and interfaces (for example, how search and access controls are implemented for recorded interviews) [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Comprehensiveness and clarity.** The book offers a systematic, stepwise account of oral history from project conception through archiving, making it highly usable for designing and documenting a study [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory].
- **Integration of psychology and historiography.** Yow’s engagement with psychological research on memory strengthens her analysis of what oral history can and cannot claim, providing a nuanced view of subjectivity and recall.
- **Ethical depth.** The sustained treatment of legal, ethical and emotional issues is more extensive than in many methods texts, making ethics a substantive component of method rather than a perfunctory appendix.
- **Reflexivity.** Yow repeatedly foregrounds the positionality of the interviewer and the co-constructed nature of interviews, inviting practitioners to reflect on power, identity and institutional context.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Historical and disciplinary context.** As a mid-2000s text, the book predates more recent debates about digital oral history, data protection regimes, and computational use of qualitative data. It offers limited guidance on issues such as digital platforms, online interviewing or algorithmic analysis.
- **Anglo-American focus.** The examples and institutional references are largely drawn from North American and Anglo-American contexts, which may not fully capture the dynamics of other institutional, legal or cultural settings.
- **Limited engagement with design research.** While methodologically rich, the book does not directly address practice-led or design-research paradigms; translation is required to adapt its guidance to a design-led project.
- **Underdeveloped discussion of multimodality.** Yow focuses on audio (and, to a lesser extent, video) and textual transcripts, with little consideration of how visual materials, artefacts or spatial contexts might be integrated into oral history practice.

### Author’s credibility
- Valerie Raleigh Yow is recognised as a leading practitioner and theorist in oral history, with a substantial track record of projects and publications in the field. Her involvement with oral history associations and her longstanding practice-based expertise give the book considerable authority within the discipline [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory]. The text synthesises both scholarly literature and hands-on experience, which reinforces its credibility as a guide for practitioners.

### Contextual validity
- The guidance is most directly applicable to small- and medium-scale oral history projects in humanities and social-science contexts involving face-to-face, recorded interviews in relatively stable institutional or community settings. Its core principles—on subjectivity, memory, ethics and co-construction—generalise well beyond specific cases.
- However, some recommendations assume access to particular institutional infrastructures (archives, libraries, ethics committees) and may require adaptation in more precarious or informal research environments. Newer contexts such as online interviewing, remote fieldwork and digital platforms are not addressed explicitly and need supplementation from more recent literature.

### Comparisons
- Compared with Ritchie’s *Doing Oral History* [@Ritchie2014DoingOralHistory], Yow gives more sustained attention to psychological theories of memory and to the interpersonal dynamics of interviewing, whereas Ritchie is somewhat more procedural and institutional.
- In relation to Alessandro Portelli’s work on the “peculiarities” of oral history, which foregrounds the value of narrative and meaning over factual accuracy, Yow is closer to the pragmatic historian, insisting on triangulation and careful source criticism, while still treating subjectivity as analytically central.
- Compared with later digital- or data-focused treatments of oral history, Yow is less concerned with platform design and computational use, but her insistence on documentation and context anticipates many of the issues that arise when interviews are re-used in digital and computational environments.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- **Alternative explanations.** Yow’s emphasis on the reconstructive nature of memory and on co-constructed narratives can be read as a response to, and partial defence against, traditional historians’ scepticism about oral sources. Her stress on triangulation and documentation may be interpreted as an attempt to secure institutional legitimacy for oral history within history and the social sciences.
- **Implications for practice.** For the project, the key implication is that oral history cannot be treated as a neutral data-collection technique. Interview design, interviewer training, metadata schemas and archiving policies must be treated as interlocking design decisions that shape what kinds of knowledge can be produced and re-used.
- **Implications for theory.** The book supports a view of institutional history as an evolving set of narratives negotiated between actors, documents and later interpreters. Oral histories reveal how institutional decisions are remembered, justified or disavowed over time, providing a theoretical bridge between official records and lived experience.
- **Shaping project thinking.** Yow’s work pushes the project to:
  - design interviews around narrators’ meaning-making, not just factual chronologies;
  - treat divergences between oral and written sources as opportunities to analyse institutional memory and forgetting;
  - embed ethical and power-aware considerations into the architecture of digital tools and archives, not merely in consent forms.

- “This development is centered on a concern about the process of meaning making.” (Yow 2005, p. 1)
- “The interviewer thus sees the work as a collaboration. This is an underlying assumption in this book; the term used to describe this dynamic is ‘shared authority.’” (Yow 2005, p. 2)
- “We cannot—and do not wish to—pretend to complete objectivity.” (Yow 2005, p. 2)

### Chapter 2 – Oral History and Memory
- “For oral historians, memory is a vital concern.” (Yow 2005, p. 35)
- “It is clear now that we construct narratives from our memories.” (Yow 2005, p. 35)
- “Since memory produces the oral testimony that is the basis of our work as oral historians, we need all the knowledge about memory we can get.” (Yow 2005, p. 36)

### Chapter 6 – Interpersonal Relations in the Interview
- “First, the recording of an oral history is a collaborative venture.” (Yow 2005, p. 157)
- “Many of us, trained in traditional research methods using written sources, have little preparation in relating to the living witness.” (Yow 2005, p. 157)
- “Interpersonal relationships are affected by age, race, gender, social class, status, ethnicity, and subculture.” (Yow 2005, p. 179)

## Questions for further research
- How should Yow’s guidance be adapted for digital-first oral history projects, including remote interviewing, online consent and long-term digital preservation?
- What additional protocols are needed when interviews are intended for computational analysis (for example, natural-language processing, multimodal RAG, or taxonomic modelling)?
- How do power dynamics play out differently in institutional oral histories compared with community or family histories, and what implications does this have for project design and ethics?
- In what ways do institutional narratives constructed through oral history diverge from official archives, and how can these divergences be systematically analysed within the project’s theoretical frame?
- How might design-research methods (prototyping, speculative scenarios, co-design sessions) be integrated with oral history interviews to surface alternative memories, counterfactuals or unrealised institutional trajectories?
