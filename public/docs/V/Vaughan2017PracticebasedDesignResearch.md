# Scope of this note
This extended critical note analyses Laurene Vaughan’s *Practice-based Design Research* (2017), focusing on Chapters 2 and 11 and triangulating them with Joyce Yee’s complementary discussion of the “researcherly designer” and “designerly researcher”. It interprets Vaughan’s framework through the lens of the DDR project *From systematic design to designerly knowing: codifying epistemic drift at the RCA Department of Design Research 1965–85*. The analysis positions Vaughan as a contemporary theorist consolidating the philosophical and pedagogical consequences of the epistemic drift first initiated by Archer: the movement from a closed, systematic model of design science to an open, reflexive ecology of practice-based knowing.

# Purpose and aim
Vaughan’s central objective is to articulate practice-based research as a mature epistemic mode and to clarify its value to both academy and profession. She aims to define how designer-practitioner-researchers generate knowledge through the acts of making and reflection that constitute their practice. Where Archer sought to formalise design as science, Vaughan seeks to pluralise it as praxis—dynamic, situated and performative. Her book reframes the design doctorate as the site where knowledge is simultaneously produced, embodied and disseminated. The question animating her project is not *whether* practice can produce knowledge, but *how* such knowledge may be rendered rigorous, communicable and transformative across sites of practice.

# Methodology
Vaughan employs a meta-methodological synthesis combining historical tracing (Jarvis 1999, Frayling 1993), educational theory (Lave & Wenger 1991; Schön 1983) and qualitative case vignettes from her own supervision practice. This composite method demonstrates the iterative learning process through which a designer becomes a “designer-practitioner-researcher”. The analysis is underpinned by practice theory (Schatzki 2001) and by an ethos of situated learning—“legitimate peripheral participation”—which understands research and practice as co-constitutive social acts. Rather than proposing a fixed protocol, Vaughan models a reflexive methodology: theory is developed *in and through* practice, the researcher learns by doing, and the research artefacts become both evidence and outcome.

# Key findings and arguments
## 1. The emergence of the designer-practitioner-researcher
Vaughan identifies a generational shift: practitioners across domains now conduct research to enhance their own fields. Building on Jarvis, she observes that the dichotomy of academic theory versus applied practice has collapsed; practice itself is a site of theoretical production. The “designer-practitioner-researcher” is a hybrid identity in which professional expertise and scholarly inquiry intersect. Crucially, practice here is *not* auxiliary to research—it *is* research when critically framed, documented and situated.

## 2. Frayling revisited: into, for, through
Reinterpreting Frayling’s triad, Vaughan argues that 'into', 'for', and 'through' are not separate categories but phases in a continuous loop of reflective enquiry. “Through” is privileged because it captures the epistemic moment when making becomes knowing. The practitioner’s reflective capacity—what Schön called reflection-in-action—is the mechanism that converts tacit experience into explicit, shareable insight. This principle aligns with the DDR project’s own model of iterative taxonomic re-classification: knowledge emerges from reflexive engagement with one’s artefacts and categories.

## 3. Doctorates as sites of transformation
Vaughan’s case studies (Amelia, Balia, Carlos) exemplify doctoral study as an ontological transformation rather than a credentialing exercise. The candidate moves from designer to designer-practitioner to designer-practitioner-researcher. This trajectory echoes the DDR’s historical arc from technical modelling to epistemic pluralism. In both, learning is situated in practice and produces a new kind of “advanced knowledge worker” (Boud & Lee 2009)—a subject capable of operating across disciplinary and institutional boundaries.

## 4. Situated learning and embodied knowledge
Drawing on Lave & Wenger and Schatzki, Vaughan situates design research within networks of social practice. Knowledge is embodied, materially mediated and context-specific. The researcher must negotiate between two sites: the university (with its structures of validation) and the professional world (with its tacit protocols). This dual positioning directly parallels the DDR’s oscillation between academic systematisation and industrial application. For both, knowledge is generated through movement between these contexts rather than within either alone.

## 5. Literacies of design
In Chapter 11, Vaughan expands literacy' beyond textual competence to include the multimodal capacities through which designers engage the world—visual, spatial, material, gestural and digital. She aligns this with Gardner’s 'multiple intelligences' and Cross’s 'designerly ways of knowing' For Vaughan, design literacy is not ancillary to research literacy: it *is* the mode through which designerly knowledge becomes communicable. This idea of plural literacies underpins the DDR project’s methodological ambition to translate archival knowledge across text, image and data—to build a taxonomy that is itself multimodal.

## 6. The design PhD as a multi-literacy platform
Vaughan argues that practice-based design doctorates must embody the literacies they study. The submission—whether text, artefact or digital platform—should itself perform the integration of knowing, doing and showing. She rejects the notion of a single 'correct' thesis form, proposing instead an ecology of submissions combining project work, exegesis and oral defence. The measure of rigour is not conformity but the coherence between *form, fit and function* (Vaughan & Morrison 2014). This is directly relevant to the DDR platform in development: a research artefact that must itself demonstrate epistemic rigour through its designed interface.

## 7. Embracing design as literacy and dissemination
Vaughan’s notion of 'embracing design literacies' has dual meaning: design as a means of knowledge production and as a medium of dissemination. She insists that design research should be expressed in designerly form—through visualisation, prototyping, and material articulation—because these are the languages through which the discipline thinks. The DDR project extends this principle digitally: its semantic and graphical interfaces turn archival research into a performative act of design communication.

## 8. The doctorate as a site of epistemic negotiation
Vaughan reframes the PhD as a crucible where multiple epistemologies—academic, professional, artistic—negotiate legitimacy. Rather than assimilating design to social-science conventions, she calls for the academy to adapt to design’s plural literacies. This reverses the logic of Archer’s 1970s revolution: instead of making design more like science, Vaughan makes the academy more like design. Her argument therefore embodies the epistemic drift this PhD investigates.

# Relevance
For the DDR project, Vaughan provides the theoretical scaffolding for translating practice-based epistemology into computational form. Her articulation of situated, multimodal literacy offers a conceptual basis for the project’s multimodal API and critical taxonomy. The designer-practitioner-researcher becomes a model for the *researcher-practitioner-archivist*: someone who both analyses and re-designs archival structures. Her insistence on alignment between content and form legitimises treating the DDR platform itself as a designed research output, not merely a tool. Moreover, her rejection of disciplinary hierarchy validates the project’s hybrid method—combining historiography, critical taxonomy and AI-assisted modelling—as a legitimate practice-based inquiry.

# Project integration
**Why it helps the project:**  
- Provides an epistemological bridge between Archer’s systematic design science and Cross’s interpretivist pluralism.  
- Justifies the project’s fusion of archival analysis and computational prototyping as practice-based research “through design.”  
- Positions the PhD candidate as designer-practitioner-researcher operating across archival and technological domains.  
- Offers a framework for evaluating the DDR platform as both method and artefact.  

**Hooks:**  
- **Workstreams →** Framing theory (practice-based epistemology), method design (modelling as literacy), reflective evaluation.  
- **Deliverables →** Documentation of the platform as practice-based exegesis; integration of designerly literacies into metadata visualisation.  
- **Stakeholders →** RCA/V&A archives, design educators, digital humanists.

# Critical evaluation
### Strengths
Vaughan’s synthesis of pedagogy, epistemology and professional practice is one of the most comprehensive treatments of practice-based research to date. Her clarity on transformation—designer to practitioner to researcher—gives the design PhD conceptual precision. The emphasis on literacies situates design within a global discourse on multimodality and intelligence. Most importantly, her recognition that design is both method and medium aligns with the DDR project’s ambition to create research outputs that *perform* their arguments.

### Weaknesses and limitations
While persuasive, Vaughan’s framework presumes a relatively privileged access to institutional resources and ignores the structural inequalities shaping doctoral participation. The rhetoric of “becoming” risks romanticising transformation without interrogating precarity. Moreover, by privileging individual reflexivity, she underplays collective and systemic dimensions of knowledge production—areas where the DDR archive reveals institutional, not personal, epistemic negotiation. Her celebration of plural literacies sometimes blurs into relativism: the tension between accessibility and rigour remains unresolved.

### Author’s credibility
Laurene Vaughan, a leading Australian scholar and practitioner, has extensive supervisory and institutional experience across RMIT and international networks. Her authority stems from direct engagement with practice-based doctorates and policy work in higher education. Her positionality as designer-educator-administrator gives her text both authenticity and normative influence: it is as much field report as theory.

### Contextual validity
Vaughan’s arguments reflect the global consolidation of design PhDs in the 2000s–2010s, especially in Australasia and Scandinavia. Her framework generalises well across creative disciplines but assumes a relatively stable institutional environment. For contexts of archival or computational research, her emphasis on embodiment must be translated into digital affordances—the project’s contribution lies precisely in extending her insights to machine-mediated practice.

### Comparisons
Archer (1978) sought to codify design as a system; Vaughan dissolves system into ecology. Cross (2007) located designerly knowledge in cognition; Vaughan relocates it in practice. Frayling (1993) mapped categories; Vaughan makes them fluid. In historiographical terms, she represents the culmination of the epistemic drift initiated by the DDR: from taxonomy as fixity to taxonomy as reflexive process.

# Interpretation
Vaughan’s *Practice-based Design Research* is the theoretical mirror image of Archer’s *Revolution*: where Archer built an edifice of classification, Vaughan opens a field of negotiation. She completes the transition from design science to designerly knowing by institutionalising reflexivity as method. For the DDR project, she supplies the philosophical licence to treat archival classification as design practice—iterative, situated, multimodal, and ethically reflexive. The DDR’s static taxonomy becomes, in Vaughan’s terms, a *living literacy*: a means of thinking through making, now enacted in code.  

In integrating her insights, the project can frame its digital platform as a twenty-first-century instantiation of the designer-practitioner-researcher model—an infrastructure that learns by doing, reclassifies by reflecting, and communicates through its designed form. Vaughan thus provides not only context but method: a guide to transforming research itself into design.

# Questions for further research
1. How can Vaughan’s notion of *design literacy* inform the computational design of multimodal archival platforms?  
2. What are the ethical and political dimensions of “situated research” when transposed into digital infrastructures?  
3. Can the designer-practitioner-researcher model scale beyond the individual to institutional or algorithmic levels of reflexivity?  
4. How might AI systems embody or simulate “knowing-through-doing,” and what epistemic status would such knowledge hold?  
5. To what extent does the DDR project enact Vaughan’s claim that the academy must learn from design rather than the reverse?  

**Synthesis:**  
Vaughan’s text transforms practice-based design research from a marginal methodology into a central epistemology of contemporary scholarship. It provides the theoretical vocabulary—practice, literacy, situated learning, reflexivity—through which the DDR archive can be re-imagined as a living, computationally activated infrastructure. Her revolution is not of method but of medium: the recognition that *how* knowledge is made and communicated is itself the content of design research.
