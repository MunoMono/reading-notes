# Scope of this note

This note focuses on four essays in *Understanding Understanding*:  

- **Chapter 4 – “Molecular Ethology, An Immodest Proposal for Semantic Clarification”** (pp. 133–167)  
- **Chapter 9 – “Cybernetics of Epistemology”** (pp. 229–244)  
- **Chapter 13 – “Cybernetics of Cybernetics”** (pp. 283–286)  
- **Chapter 14 – “Ethics and Second-Order Cybernetics”** (pp. 287–303)  

For the purposes of the project spine, chapter 14 is treated as the fourth focal text because it completes the move from epistemology to ethics.

Together these essays provide the conceptual backbone for second-order cybernetics: from molecular accounts of cognition, through recursive epistemology, to the social and ethical implications of observers observing themselves and each other.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Across these essays, von Foerster pursues a coherent cluster of questions:

1. **What kind of conceptual and formal apparatus is needed to understand cognition?**  
   Chapter 4 asks how one might construct a “molecular ethology” linking behaviour to microscopic mechanisms, and concludes that the right level is not “behaviour” or “memory” as separate functions but the more inclusive phenomenon of **cognition** (pp. 164–165).

2. **What form must an epistemology take if it is to do justice to cognitive processes rather than static “knowledge”?**  
   Chapter 9 reframes epistemology as the **theory of knowledge acquisition**, not of knowledge itself, arguing that only cybernetics, with its treatment of circular causality, can provide a satisfactory framework (p. 229).

3. **What happens when cybernetics turns upon itself and includes the observer?**  
   Chapter 13 formalises second-order cybernetics as a *cybernetics of cybernetics*, framed through Maturana’s and von Foerster’s theorems that “anything said is said by an observer” and “anything said is said to an observer” (p. 283).

4. **What are the ethical consequences of second-order cybernetics?**  
   Chapter 14 explicitly couples cybernetics with ethics, arguing that when observers are included in their descriptions, questions of autonomy and responsibility become unavoidable (pp. 287–289, 299–300).

Taken together, these essays ask how one can rigorously conceptualise **observing systems** whose operations generate their own realities, and how such a view reshapes scientific practice, social organisation and ethical responsibility.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

The methodology is explicitly **theoretical and conceptual**, but grounded in several domains:

- **Formal and logical construction**  
  - Use of recursive function theory, fixed points and Eigen-values/Eigen-behaviours to describe cognitive processes (e.g. recursive operators COORD and their Eigen-values in Chapter 11, heavily relied on in Chapters 9, 13 and 14; pp. 261–266).  
  - Circular causality and closure are treated through diagrams, recursion equations and operator notation rather than empirical models.

- **Analogy and cross-domain transfer**  
  - Chapter 4 builds a bridge from molecular genetics to behaviour via the analogy of a *program* and its *computation* (pp. 133–134).  
  - Thermodynamics is used to connect microscopic processes (energy levels, entropy) to macroscopic behaviours (learning, memory) (pp. 160–162).

- **Neurophysiological and biochemical references**  
  - The discussion of molecular stores, molecular computers and molecular carriers (pp. 160–162) references experimental work on nuclear RNA, metastable states and mitochondrial energy cycles, but always as conceptual scaffolding rather than as detailed empirical reporting.

- **Historical and discursive reconstruction**  
  - Chapter 9 reconstructs the Macy Conferences and the emergence of cybernetics to motivate why epistemology must turn to circular causality (pp. 229–231).  
  - Chapter 14 draws on quotations and paraphrases from Wiener, Mead, Bateson and others to situate second-order cybernetics within a wider intellectual and social history (pp. 287–292).

- **Rhetorical “thought experiments”**  
  - The “postulate of epistemic homeostasis” (p. 244) is proposed as a theoretical guideline for research rather than as a tested hypothesis.  
  - Examples such as “obscenity” are used to show that certain categories depend on the observer and cannot be read off objects (pp. 283–284).

There is no empirical “sample” in a conventional sense. The unit of analysis is the **observing system** (brain, organism, society of observers), and the method is to derive its properties from the requirement of closure and recursion.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

#### 1. Chapter 4 – Molecular Ethology (pp. 133–167)

1. **From behaviour and memory to cognition**  
   - Von Foerster argues that concepts such as memory, learning and behaviour should be seen as distinct manifestations of a more general phenomenon: **cognition** (pp. 163–164).  
   - He critiques naive “recording” models of memory as inadequate because they cannot, by themselves, support *induction* or *generalisation* (pp. 160–161).  
   - Only when a system *computes* generalisations over records—rather than simply storing them—can it support viable behaviour.

2. **Semantic clarification via molecular mechanisms**  
   - Inspired by molecular genetics, he proposes a “molecular ethology” linking behaviour to microscopic units, but notes that such a field has “not yet been blessed by success” (p. 133).  
   - He shows that the semantic structure of language (nouns for relatively stable forms, verbs for changes and movements) reflects basic cognitive asymmetries (pp. 133–134).  
   - The difficulty of identifying “units of behaviour” mirrors the problem of defining semantic primitives.

3. **Three molecular mechanisms and finite-state machines**  
   - He distinguishes three molecular mechanisms:  
     - **Molecular store** – energy in/energy out; model of metastable states as memory traces (pp. 160–161).  
     - **Molecular computer** – energy in/structure out; structural changes as computations (pp. 160–161).  
     - **Molecular carrier** – energy and structure in/energy out; cyclic processes moving energy between sites (pp. 161–162).  
   - These mechanisms are cast as finite-state machines, allowing the same formalism to bridge molecular and behavioural descriptions (pp. 160–162).

4. **Cognition turns the environment into a trivial machine**  
   - He concludes that one should search for mechanisms **within organisms** that enable them “to turn their environment into a trivial machine, rather than [for] mechanisms in the environment that turn the organisms into trivial machines” (pp. 163–164).  
   - A trivial machine is one whose outputs are fully determined and predictable from inputs and internal structure; non-trivial machines change their own state and rules.  
   - This shift underpins second-order cybernetics: the organism’s own organisation is primary; environment appears through that organisation.

5. **Eigen-values, recursion and hierarchical organisation**  
   - He introduces recursive functionals as a way to move from “facts” to “descriptions of facts” to “descriptions of descriptions of facts” and so on (pp. 163–164).  
   - This hierarchy of descriptive domains anticipates the later formal treatment of Eigen-values, Eigen-behaviours and meta-operators (developed fully in Chapter 11 and presupposed in Chapters 13–14).

#### 2. Chapter 9 – Cybernetics of Epistemology (pp. 229–244)

1. **Epistemology as theory of acquisition, not of knowledge**  
   - Von Foerster defines epistemology as the theory of *how* knowledge is acquired, not of what knowledge “is” (p. 229).  
   - With this definition, he argues that “any epistemology claiming completeness will be some form of cybernetic theory” because it must address circular causal processes in cognition (pp. 229–230).

2. **Closing the causal chain: from linear to circular**  
   - Classical science assumes an open, linear causal chain: stimuli → nervous system → behaviour.  
   - Cybernetics introduces **circular causality**, closing this chain by feeding outputs back into inputs and by recognising that the nervous system is operationally closed (pp. 231–233).  
   - This closure implies that what is called “reality” must be seen as the nervous system’s *stable patterns of activity* rather than as an independent given.

3. **Computations computing computations: recursion and depth**  
   - Cognitive processes are modelled as algorithms that themselves are computed by other processes; this leads to “computations that compute computations” and regress of arbitrary depth (pp. 229–230).  
   - This recursive picture supports the interpretation of perception and knowledge as **Eigen-values** of recursive operations, not direct reflections of an external world.

4. **Epistemic homeostasis and stable realities**  
   - He formulates the **postulate of epistemic homeostasis**: “the nervous system as a whole is organized in such a way (organizes itself in such a way) that it computes a stable reality” (p. 244).  
   - Stability (Eigen-values) is more fundamental than correspondence; reality is that which remains invariant under recursive operations of the nervous system.

5. **Epistemology, autonomy and ethics**  
   - The closure of the cognitive loop implies autonomy: the causes of one’s actions are not “somewhere else or with somebody else” but within the system (pp. 243–244).  
   - This autonomy has immediate ethical consequences: responsibility cannot be off-loaded onto external causes or structures.  
   - The essay thus sets up the later explicit ethical arguments by showing that epistemology already carries ethical implications.

#### 3. Chapter 13 – Cybernetics of Cybernetics (pp. 283–286)

1. **Maturana’s Theorem and von Foerster’s Corollary**  
   - Von Foerster opens by baptising “Humberto Maturana’s Theorem Number One”: *“Anything said is said by an observer”* (p. 283).  
   - He adds *“Heinz von Foerster’s Corollary Number One”*: *“Anything said is said to an observer”* (p. 283).  
   - These two propositions connect three concepts: observer, language and society. Observers are those who make descriptions; language links observers; society emerges from linguistically connected observers (pp. 283–284).

2. **From first-order to second-order cybernetics**  
   - First-order cybernetics is the cybernetics of **observed systems**; the observer remains outside and stipulates the system’s purpose.  
   - Second-order cybernetics is the cybernetics of **observing systems**, where the observer’s own purpose and operations are included in the description (pp. 285–286).  
   - Von Foerster links this to Pask’s distinction between first- and second-order stipulations of purpose (p. 285).

3. **Observer, objectivity and the lie of “view from nowhere”**  
   - Building on his critique of “objectivity”, he characterises as “nonsense” the claim that “the properties of the observer shall not enter the description of his observations” (pp. 283–284).  
   - Attempts to legislate properties of “obscenity” demonstrate that such categories are observer-dependent; laws that treat them as object properties become “dangerous nonsense” (p. 283).  
   - The move is not from objectivity to subjectivity, but to a new question: *what are the properties of an observer?* (p. 284).

4. **Theory of the observer: recursion and self-reference**  
   - A theory of the observer must grapple with self-reference. Von Foerster notes that the necessary conceptual pillars already exist:  
     - A calculus of infinite recursions.  
     - A calculus of self-reference (citing Varela’s work on self-referential calculi).  
   - With these, one can rigorously treat **observing**, not just the observed (pp. 284–285).

5. **Social cybernetics as second-order cybernetics**  
   - Social systems are inherently second-order, because observers within them stipulate their own purposes.  
   - If one fails to recognise autonomy, society risks becoming one in which people transfer responsibility for their actions (“I just obey orders”) and “attempt to honor commitments and forget about responsibilities” (p. 285).  
   - Social cybernetics must therefore be a **cybernetics of cybernetics**, to keep responsibility with the actors.

#### 4. Chapter 14 – Ethics and Second-Order Cybernetics (pp. 287–303)

1. **Ethics and second-order cybernetics are inseparable**  
   - Von Foerster begins by noting he would never have dared propose such an “outrageous title” himself, but accepts that ethics and second-order cybernetics belong together (p. 287).  
   - He states that it is “impossible to talk about ethics” directly, but that one can talk about cybernetics in such a way that ethical issues emerge (pp. 287–288).

2. **Multiple articulations of cybernetics**  
   - He rehearses various definitions of cybernetics: Wiener’s purposive behaviour, Mead’s cross-disciplinary “language which all could understand”, and others (pp. 288–292).  
   - A unifying thread is **circular organisation**: systems whose sensory outputs affect their effectors and vice versa (pp. 287–288).

3. **From trivial to non-trivial machines**  
   - Building on earlier work, he contrasts **trivial machines** (fixed, predictable input–output relations) with **non-trivial machines** (which change their internal state and rules over time).  
   - Human beings and social systems are non-trivial machines; treating them as trivial (e.g. in rigid bureaucratic or technocratic schemes) is both epistemically false and ethically dangerous (pp. 293–296).

4. **Ethics as a property of the observer’s decisions**  
   - Ethics is located not in rules or external norms but in the **decisions of autonomous observers**.  
   - Second-order cybernetics foregrounds this because it obliges observers to see themselves as part of the system they describe; they cannot claim neutrality.  
   - Von Foerster thus re-casts ethics as a question of **how one chooses the constraints** under which one acts and observes (pp. 297–300).

5. **Responsibility, autonomy and social design**  
   - Ethical responsibility is directly linked to the recognition of autonomy: “if we fail to recognize autonomy of each, we may turn into a society that attempts to honor commitments and forgets about its responsibilities” (cf. pp. 285, 299–300).  
   - He insists that recognising the second-order nature of social systems is a precondition for non-authoritarian, non-heteronomous forms of social organisation.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

For the DDR project and its three-strand framework (technical infrastructure, participatory practice, critical-theoretical reflection), these essays offer:

- **A robust conceptualisation of the archive as an observing system**  
  - The archive (and the AI systems layered on top of it) can be understood as a non-trivial machine that computes its own “stable reality”—its Eigen-behaviours—through recursive processes of description, indexing and retrieval (cf. pp. 163–164, 229–231, 261–266).  
  - This shifts attention from “representing the past” to understanding how archival infrastructures *construct* stable realities.

- **A theoretical justification for observer-inclusion in design and evaluation**  
  - Chapters 9, 13 and 14 provide the rationale for including archivists, contributors and users as observers within the system, not as external evaluators.  
  - This aligns with participatory and conversational approaches in the project’s methods spine.

- **An explicit ethical frame for infrastructural decisions**  
  - The move from epistemology to ethics underwrites a view of technical decisions (data models, ontologies, interfaces) as ethical decisions about which Eigen-behaviours to stabilise and which observers to empower (pp. 244, 283–285, 297–300).

---

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Non-trivial machine vs trivial machine (Chapter 4, Chapter 14)**  
  - For DDR’s AI-assisted linked-data archive, the central task is to avoid treating users as trivial machines that merely respond to stimuli.  
  - Von Foerster’s insistence on mechanisms within organisms that turn the environment into a trivial machine (pp. 163–164) translates into design questions:  
    - How does the archive enable users to domesticate an otherwise non-transparent “data environment”?  
    - How can interfaces expose the non-trivial character of the system, rather than masking it behind deterministic recommendations?

- **Epistemic homeostasis and RAG architectures (Chapter 9)**  
  - The “postulate of epistemic homeostasis” (p. 244) can structure thinking about retrieval-augmented generation:  
    - The question is not only whether outputs are “accurate”, but how the system maintains a **coherent, stable reality** while remaining open to new inputs and corrections.  
    - This supports the project’s concern with epistemic drift and how feedback loops (usage statistics, click data, editorial interventions) re-shape the archive’s “reality”.

- **Eigen-behaviours and objects as tokens (Chapter 11, presupposed in 13–14)**  
  - Although not one of the four focal chapters, “Objects: Tokens for (Eigen-)Behaviors” (pp. 261–267) is conceptually indispensable. It shows that objects are **tokens for stable behaviours**, emerging from recursive coordinations.  
  - For DDR, “documents”, “entities” and “events” can be treated as tokens for the system’s Eigen-behaviours (query patterns, editorial practices, modelling conventions).  
  - Chapters 13 and 14 then frame how multiple observers negotiate these tokens in social space, giving a theoretical basis for collaborative cataloguing and user-generated annotations.

- **Ethics of design and governance (Chapter 13–14)**  
  - Second-order cybernetics demands that those designing and governing the archive acknowledge their role as observers shaping reality.  
  - This speaks directly to governance questions: who sets the purposes of the system, who can revise them, and how is responsibility for harm or exclusion recognised rather than displaced (“the model did it”, “the algorithm decided”).

### Hooks into the project

- **Workstreams →**  
  - *Technical and data workstream*:  
    - Use Eigen-value/Eigen-behaviour language to frame how schemas, ontologies and models stabilise particular realities (Ch. 9, 11).  
    - Apply the trivial/non-trivial machine distinction to evaluate degrees of adaptability of the infrastructure (Ch. 4, 14).  
  - *Participatory / co-design workstream*:  
    - Use Maturana’s and von Foerster’s theorems as design prompts: “who is the observer?” and “to whom is this said?” for every interface, message and model output (Ch. 13).  
  - *Ethics, governance and policy workstream*:  
    - Ground discussions of responsibility, bias and inclusion in the second-order ethics articulated in Chapter 14.

- **Deliverables →**  
  - Conceptual section in the thesis or technical white paper explaining DDR as a second-order cybernetic system.  
  - Methodological guidance document: “Observing the archive observing itself,” based on Chapters 9 and 13.  
  - Ethical framework or code of practice for AI-assisted archival work, explicitly drawing on Chapter 14.

- **Stakeholders →**  
  - Archivists and librarians: positioned as observers within the system, responsible for stipulating purposes rather than merely implementing external policies.  
  - Contributors/interviewees: recognised as autonomous observers whose narratives co-determine the archive’s Eigen-behaviours.  
  - Technologists and AI vendors: reframed as participants in a second-order system, accountable for how their tools shape epistemic homeostasis and ethical trajectories.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths

- **Conceptual depth and coherence**  
  - The four essays fit together as stages in a single argument: from molecular mechanism, to epistemological closure, to social and ethical implications.  
  - The use of fixed-point concepts (Eigen-values, Eigen-behaviours) provides a powerful way to talk about stability in recursive systems across scales.

- **Cross-disciplinary reach**  
  - Von Foerster effectively weaves together thermodynamics, neurophysiology, logic, language philosophy and social theory.  
  - This breadth maps nicely onto a project like DDR which itself spans technical, social and theoretical concerns.

- **Normative clarity**  
  - The ethical stance is not hidden: autonomy and responsibility are foregrounded, and heteronomous “I just obey orders” positions are explicitly criticised (pp. 285, 299–300).  
  - This explicitness is valuable for a project that must justify its own normative commitments.

- **Richness of metaphors and thought experiments**  
  - Distinctions between trivial and non-trivial machines, or between observer-excluded and observer-included epistemologies, are clear and portable across contexts.  
  - The “obscenity” example is particularly sharp in exposing the limits of objectivist legal and technical classifications (p. 283).

### Weaknesses and limitations

- **High level of abstraction and mathematical density**  
  - The treatment of recursive functionals, Eigen-values and operator hierarchies is concise and assumes a mathematically literate reader (pp. 261–266, 268–269).  
  - For design-oriented or practice-based audiences (e.g. RCA, GLAM practitioners), substantial translation work is needed to make these ideas actionable.

- **Limited empirical grounding**  
  - The references to molecular and neurophysiological experiments are often cursory and dated.  
  - Von Foerster does not engage with more recent cognitive science or neuroscience, so the biological stories risk being read as “just-so” narratives rather than robust models.

- **Potentially underdeveloped account of power and structural inequality**  
  - Although he recognises that ignoring autonomy leads to societies that shift responsibility, the essays do not systematically engage with questions of power, race, gender or colonial knowledge structures.  
  - For DDR, which deals with archival silences and structural exclusions, this is a gap that must be filled by bringing in critical archival studies, STS and decolonial theory.

- **Ethics framed primarily at the level of individual observers**  
  - The ethical argument focuses on individual autonomy and decision-making.  
  - Institutional, legal and infrastructural constraints play a minimal explicit role, which may understate how strongly observers’ “choices” are shaped by structural conditions.

### Author’s credibility

- Heinz von Foerster is a central figure in cybernetics: organiser of the Macy Conferences, founder of the Biological Computer Laboratory, and a key proponent of second-order cybernetics.  
- The essays are largely revised or reprinted from earlier, influential publications, and the volume itself functions as a curated retrospective of his oeuvre.  
- His credibility within cybernetics, systems theory and radical constructivism is very high; outside these communities, the work is less widely cited, which partly reflects disciplinary fragmentation rather than lack of merit.

### Contextual validity

- The arguments are pitched at a very general level (properties of observing systems, recursive closure, Eigen-values). As such, they are intended to be **context-transcendent**.  
- However, the empirical illustrations (molecular models, early AI, 1960s–70s social context) are dated. Translating the framework to contemporary AI and archival infrastructures requires interpretive work.  
- The most robustly generalisable elements are:  
  - The necessity of including the observer in epistemology.  
  - The centrality of recursion and closure for understanding stability.  
  - The ethical linkage between autonomy and responsibility.

### Comparisons

- **Gregory Bateson** – Shares the emphasis on circular causality and “difference that makes a difference”, but von Foerster provides more formal machinery (Eigen-values, recursion calculus).  
- **Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela** – Their concept of autopoiesis and biology of cognition is foundational for von Foerster’s observer; he, in turn, pushes further into ethical territory.  
- **Niklas Luhmann** – Later systematises social systems as communication systems with operational closure; von Foerster’s essays can be read as one of Luhmann’s conceptual sources, especially regarding recursion and Eigen-behaviours.  
- **Critical archival and STS literature** – These essays prefigure later critiques of objectivity and neutrality but do not engage with specific institutional or political histories. Their strength is conceptual rather than empirical.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights

- **Archive as second-order cybernetic system**  
  - The DDR project can treat the archive not as a passive repository but as a **non-trivial observing system** that computes its own stable realities (Eigen-behaviours) from recursive loops of description, retrieval and use.  
  - This view directly supports conversation-based and participatory methods: new descriptions and queries do not simply “access” data, they **recalculate** the archive’s reality.

- **RAG as epistemic homeostasis machine**  
  - Retrieval-augmented generation systems can be interpreted as mechanisms for **epistemic homeostasis**: they maintain and adjust a stable reality produced jointly by the underlying corpus and the generative model.  
  - This reframes concerns about hallucination or drift as questions about how the system’s recursive loops are calibrated and who is allowed to intervene in them.

- **Design as ethical stipulation of purpose**  
  - Following Pask and von Foerster, the “stipulation of purpose” becomes a key site of ethical decision.  
  - For DDR, design choices about ranking, visibility, and metadata structures are **second-order stipulations**—decisions about the purposes of the observing system itself.  
  - Ethics here is not an after-the-fact compliance layer but the practice of making these stipulations explicit, revisable and collectively owned.

- **Conversation as topology of closure**  
  - The “topology of closure” (cognition computing its own cognitions through those of the other; pp. 266–267) aligns closely with the project’s interest in conversation theory and dialogic methods.  
  - Interviews, annotations and user feedback can be modelled as loops in which the Eigen-behaviours of one participant recursively generate those of another, giving rise to shared objects (tokens) and shared ethical concerns.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory

- **Practice**  
  - Treat every interface, data model and AI-assisted workflow as a **statement by and to an observer**. Ask: who is speaking, and to whom?  
  - Design affordances that let users see and modulate the system’s non-trivial character (e.g. exposing uncertainty, alternative paths, provenance).

- **Policy**  
  - Governance frameworks should explicitly acknowledge autonomy and responsibility rather than hiding behind “the system”.  
  - Policies should specify who can alter the archive’s Eigen-behaviours (e.g. amend ontologies, reconfigure ranking) and through what recursive feedback processes.

- **Theory**  
  - Von Foerster’s work can provide the **cybernetic backbone** of the thesis, to be woven together with conversation theory, critical archival studies and decolonial perspectives.  
  - His formalism offers a way to talk rigorously about the project’s key concepts—epistemic drift, archival silence, infrastructural bias—in terms of recursion, closure and Eigen-behaviour.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase

- “Molecular genetics is one example of a successful bridge that links a phenomenology of macroscopic things … with the structure and function of a few microscopic elementary units” (p. 133).  
- **Paraphrase:** Chapter 4 proposes that memory, learning and behaviour should be understood as different manifestations of cognition, and that these should be described using recursive functionals that move from facts to descriptions of facts and beyond (pp. 163–164).  

- “Cybernetics of Epistemology” defines epistemology as the theory of knowledge acquisition and argues that any complete epistemology must be cybernetic because it must account for circular causality (pp. 229–231).  

- “The nervous system as a whole is organized in such a way (organizes itself in such a way) that it computes a stable reality” – the **postulate of epistemic homeostasis** (p. 244).  

- “Anything said is said by an observer” and “Anything said is said to an observer” (p. 283).  

- Von Foerster’s critique of objectivity as the “nonsense” claim that the properties of the observer do not enter descriptions (pp. 283–284).  

- The warning that if we fail to recognise autonomy, we risk a society in which people claim “I am not responsible for my actions; I just obey orders” (pp. 285, 299–300).

## Questions for further research

- How can Eigen-behaviours and Eigen-objects be operationalised in the analysis of DDR usage data and AI logs?  
- What concrete design patterns instantiate second-order cybernetic principles in digital archival interfaces?  
- How might von Foerster’s ethically inflected autonomy be reconciled with structural analyses of power and inequality in archival institutions?  
- In what ways do contemporary machine-learning systems instantiate or resist the trivial/non-trivial machine distinction?  
- How can conversation-theoretic models (e.g. Pask) be integrated with von Foerster’s recursion-and-Eigen-value framework to model participatory archival work as a topology of closure?
