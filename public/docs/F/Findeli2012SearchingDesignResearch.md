# Scope of this note
Focuses on Findeli’s redefinition of design research as an ethical, teleological, and reflexive practice—emphasising *why* we ask certain questions as much as *how* we pursue them. It bridges DDR’s instrumental rationality and the project’s ethics of data provenance, participatory classification, and computational reflexivity.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Findeli revisits the foundations of design research to clarify its epistemological stance and ethical purpose. He argues that the field has relied too heavily on definitions limited to designerly cognition (Archer, Cross) and calls for a broader framework in which design research addresses human ecology—relationships between people and their environments—through a projective, value-laden stance.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
The essay is conceptual and didactic rather than empirical. Findeli analyses the intellectual lineage of design research—from Archer’s systematicism to Cross’s “designerly ways of knowing”—and critiques their focus on the *conception* side of design while neglecting *reception* and use. Drawing on pragmatism, hermeneutics, and human ecology, he develops the “Bremen Model” and articulates “project-grounded research” as a methodological framework integrating reflection, ethics, and practice.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Design research concerns human ecology.** Its subject is the habitability of the world—the interface between humans and their material, social, and symbolic environments.  
2. **Its stance is projective, not descriptive.** Design research aims to transform reality rather than merely represent it.  
3. **Ethics and reflexivity are integral.** Because design operates through values and projections, epistemic vigilance is required to make its aims explicit.  
4. **Project-grounded research bridges practice and inquiry.** Design research should “put phenomena into project” to understand them.  
5. **PhD-level research must transform design questions into research questions.** This translation process is itself a design act requiring supervision, construction, and ethical self-awareness.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
Findeli’s teleological framing directly informs the DDR project’s focus on reflexivity and epistemic drift. His insistence that design research is inherently ethical and projective parallels the study’s treatment of the DDR archive as a living infrastructure shaped by moral, political, and methodological choices. Both treat research as a situated, value-laden activity that must account for its own conditions of knowledge production.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Anchors the DDR taxonomy within a **reflexive ethics of inquiry**, foregrounding that classification and data infrastructures are not neutral (pp. 72–75).  
- Provides a theoretical bridge between DDR’s **instrumental rationality** and the project’s commitment to **participatory reclassification** and data provenance.  
- Supports the methodological argument that **computational and archival systems must make their assumptions explicit**, aligning with Findeli’s epistemological vigilance (p. 69).  
- Reinforces the project’s notion of **“epistemic drift” as ethical reflection in motion**, reframing it as an act of responsibility rather than loss of rigour.  

**Findeli reframes design research as an ethical and teleological practice — what matters is not only how we research, but why we ask certain questions. This complements your essay’s emphasis on reflexivity and responsibility in computational method. It provides a bridge from DDR’s instrumental rationality to your ethics of data provenance and participatory reclassification. Use in *Reflections and Translations* or early in *Implications for Future Research*. Cite Findeli to ground your claim that computational and taxonomic tools are not neutral — they embody the researcher’s values and aims. It strengthens your argument that design research must make its questions, classifications, and infrastructures ethically explicit.**

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Reflexivity and ethics in digital infrastructures.  
- **Deliverables →** Informs ethical framework for the DDR digital taxonomy and open-data policy.  
- **Stakeholders →** Supervisors, archivists, computational humanists concerned with responsible AI and data ethics.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Establishes a robust ethical and teleological foundation for design research.  
- Integrates human ecology with project-grounded epistemology.  
- Anticipates contemporary debates about reflexivity, participation, and accountability in research design.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- The argument remains largely philosophical; lacks empirical substantiation.  
- The universal framing of “human ecology” risks vagueness.  
- Assumes the researcher’s good faith without exploring systemic power dynamics.

### Author’s credibility
Alain Findeli is a leading theorist of design epistemology and pedagogy, formerly Professor at the Université de Nîmes. His body of work defines “project-grounded research,” which underpins much of contemporary doctoral methodology in design.

### Contextual validity
Findeli’s framework generalises well across academic and applied design contexts, particularly where research involves reflexivity, interdisciplinarity, and participatory engagement.

### Comparisons
Builds upon Archer’s systematic design research and Cross’s designerly knowing, while extending both into ethical and ecological domains. Aligns with Jonas’s mode 2 epistemology and Schön’s reflective practice; diverges from Simon’s instrumental rationalism.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Findeli’s emphasis on *why* rather than *how* transforms design research from a methodological to a moral project. For the DDR study, this legitimises the argument that data systems and taxonomies are moral artefacts—each encodes assumptions about who benefits and who is visible. His notion of “epistemological vigilance” translates directly into computational reflexivity: ensuring that AI- and RAG-based classification tools expose rather than conceal their ethical commitments.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory
- Reinforces the need for **transparent design of data infrastructures** in archival research.  
- Suggests that **reflexivity is a methodological requirement**, not an optional add-on.  
- Informs future frameworks for **AI ethics in design historiography** and open research infrastructures.  

### How does it shape your thinking?
Findeli clarifies that design research must continually justify not only its methods but its intentions. This insight informs the DDR project’s insistence that classification, coding, and computational tools embody ethical and political choices. Reflexivity thus becomes a form of scholarly responsibility.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “Design research is a systematic search for and acquisition of knowledge related to general human ecology considered from a designerly way of thinking, i.e., project-oriented, perspective.” (p. 73)  
- “The world is not an object but a project.” (p. 68)  
- **Paraphrase:** Findeli insists that research questions in design must make their ethical and teleological orientations explicit; every inquiry reflects a stance toward the world and its transformation. (pp. 69–75)
