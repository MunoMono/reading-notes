# Scope of this note
This extended note critically analyses Christopher Frayling’s *Research in Art and Design* (1993) as a pivotal institutional text produced at the Royal College of Art during the post-DDR period. It codifies three modes of creative research—*into*, *through* and *for*—to legitimise practice within the university system. The reading situates this paper within the project’s interpretive–historical frame as a reformulation rather than a rupture of Bruce Archer’s systematic design paradigm: Frayling translates Archer’s procedural rationality into a rhetorically pluralist but administratively instrumental taxonomy.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Frayling asks: what counts as ‘research’ in the arts? Responding to policy debates around funding and research assessment in UK higher education, he seeks to define credible models of enquiry for art and design that align with the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) while respecting studio practice. The central objective is to resolve the tension between artistic making and the bureaucratic apparatus of academic research by constructing a typology that satisfies both artistic autonomy and institutional accountability.

---

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size
The text is discursive, argumentative and historiographic. Frayling builds his case through:

- **Lexical genealogy:** tracing the word *research* via the *OED* and its 'small-r / big-R' meanings to distinguish ordinary searching from professionalised scientific practice.  
- **Cultural stereotype analysis:** deconstructing popular images of the artist (expressive genius), designer (boffin or style warrior) and scientist (rational empiricist).  
- **Historical exempla:** referencing Picasso, Constable, Stubbs, Leonardo and others to illustrate cognitive versus expressive idioms.  
- **Conceptual synthesis:** deriving three operational categories—research *into*, *through* and *for* art and design—from Herbert Read’s pedagogical triad.  

There is no empirical sample; the argument functions as **institutional rhetoric**, combining cultural analysis with typological construction to produce a framework for policy and pedagogy.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **The 'small-r / big-R' distinction:** ‘research’ historically encompassed both artistic searching and scientific systematisation. Institutionalisation in the 20th century privileged the big-R mode—professional, procedural, externalised.  
2. **The three myths:** Frayling dismantles cultural stereotypes of the mad artist, the eccentric designer and the saintly scientist, arguing that all involve practice, tacit knowledge and iterative discovery.  
3. **Three categories of research:**
   - **Research *into* art and design:** historical, theoretical or contextual study—producing text-based knowledge.  
   - **Research *through* art and design:** studio-based investigation documented and contextualised through reflective writing.  
   - **Research *for* art and design:** preparatory work or material exploration that informs practice but may not yield explicit verbal knowledge.  
4. **The communicability threshold:** only when outcomes are documented and made public can they qualify as research; 'the art cannot simply speak for itself.'  
5. **Institutional demarcation:** the RCA will not grant research degrees solely for expressive work; the goal must be knowledge, not only artefacts.  

Together, these arguments produce a **bureaucratic taxonomy of creative research**—an attempt to reconcile tacit practice with the metrics of communicable knowledge.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
Frayling’s framework is the institutional crystallisation of the **epistemic drift** traced in the project: from Archer’s scientific proceduralism (DDR, 1960s–70s) to a pluralised but still administratively rational system (RCA, early 1990s). His triad recasts Archer’s systematic categories within the language of higher-education governance, performing the very 'translation of epistemology into policy' that the project critiques. It thus represents the *moment of bureaucratic closure* after DDR’s experimental openness.

---

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Documents how Archer’s call for *communicable knowledge* was re-articulated as a research-assessment instrument.  
- Provides empirical evidence for the **continuity thesis**: DDR systematic epistemics survive under new rhetorical guises.  
- Clarifies terminological lineage for later discourse on 'practice-based research.'  
- Offers comparative material for contrasting with Boyd Davis & Gristwood’s (2017) account of Archer’s operational model.  

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** archival reconstruction (DDR to RCA), interpretive taxonomy of research categories, comparative epistemic mapping.  
- **Deliverables →** visual model of epistemic drift (systematic → pluralist → designerly), critical re-reading of RCA policy documents.  
- **Stakeholders →** design historians, academic administrators, policy makers, practice-based researchers.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Clarity and influence:** provides a concise, portable vocabulary adopted internationally.  
- **Institutional pragmatism:** reconciles creative practice with research metrics, enabling funding and degree validation.  
- **Pedagogical legacy:** shaped decades of art-and-design PhDs and policy frameworks.  
- **Reflexive genealogy:** recognises that 'research' in art predates its scientific institutionalisation.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Instrumental closure:** transforms interpretive plurality into bureaucratic typology.  
- **Residual scientism:** preserves Archer’s communicability criterion without embracing interpretivist or critical epistemologies.  
- **Gendered and cultural bias:** assumes masculine maker archetypes and Western canons (Picasso, Constable, Stubbs).  
- **Ambiguity of 'for':** leaves the most practice-based mode conceptually underdeveloped—both valorised and disqualified.

### Author’s credibility
Frayling (b. 1946) was Professor of Cultural History at the RCA and later Rector (1996–2009). As both academic and policy actor, his authority is institutional rather than philosophical. *Research in Art and Design* functions as policy rhetoric legitimating a research culture in art schools post-polytechnic merger.

### Contextual validity
While rhetorically pluralist, the framework presupposes British academic structures of the 1990s and does not easily generalise to decolonial, feminist or non-textual epistemologies. It reflects an era when 'research' equated with accountability rather than emancipation.

### Comparisons
- **Archer (1995):** supplies procedural model; Frayling translates it into cultural policy.  
- **Cross (1982, 2007):** re-centres *designerly knowing* as an epistemic counterpoint to both science and art.  
- **Boyd Davis & Gristwood (2017):** critique Archerian operational closure that Frayling institutionalises.  
- **Bowker & Star (1999):** demonstrate how classifications (like Frayling’s triad) become moral–political infrastructures.  
- **Gooding (2022):** extends communicability into *critical addressability*, challenging Frayling’s bureaucratic transparency.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Frayling’s taxonomy represents a **translation regime**: it converts creative labour into assessable categories. The triad *into/through/for* simplifies a continuum of practices into administratively legible forms. While celebrated as legitimising practice, it simultaneously *disciplinary-captures* it—recasting tacit making as knowledge production under audit culture.  

For the project, Frayling’s text exemplifies the **institutional consolidation phase** following DDR’s epistemic experiment: knowledge becomes policy, and research becomes performance. His framework remains the dominant grammar against which later interpretivist and critical models (Cross, Bowker & Star, Gooding) react.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- **Quote:** ‘Research for art, craft and design needs a great deal of further research. Once we get used to the idea that we don't need to be scared of 'research' … the debate can really begin.’ (p. 16) → encapsulates his reformist but managerial tone.  
- **Paraphrase:** Frayling argues that research only counts when results are documented and communicated; “the art cannot simply speak for itself.” (p. 14) → institutionalises Archer’s communicability criterion.  
- **Quote:** ‘Research is a practice, writing is a practice, doing science is a practice, doing design is a practice, making art is a practice.’ (p. 13) → dissolves categorical separations but folds all into practice-as-research.  
- **Paraphrase:** The distinction *into / through / for* originates in pedagogical theory (Herbert Read) but functions here as an institutional taxonomy for art-school governance. (p. 15)

## Questions for further research
- How did Frayling’s taxonomy shape the RCA’s doctoral and funding structures post-1993?  
- To what extent does the triad naturalise neoliberal research-assessment logic?  
- Can ‘research for’ be re-interpreted as *research within*—foregrounding situated, embodied knowing rather than preparatory labour?  
- How might feminist and decolonial frameworks unsettle Frayling’s Euro-masculine genealogy of makers and scientists?  
- What alternative grammars of practice could replace the Archer–Frayling lineage in future art-research policy?

## Takeaways for the DDR project
1. Frayling’s taxonomy codifies DDR’s epistemic residues within a managerial framework—turning methodological debate into administrative protocol.  
2. It demonstrates the shift from epistemic experimentation (DDR) to institutional governance (RCA 1990s).  
3. By re-reading Frayling through Bowker & Star, the project can show how taxonomies of research function as infrastructures of control.  
4. Extending Gooding’s *critical addressability* reframes 'communicable knowledge' as ethical, situated and plural—beyond Frayling’s bureaucratic closure.
