# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** To pin an early “systematic method” moment where design judgement begins to be translated into explicit, checkable procedure that can later become an archival “testament” and shift.  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** S1 methods genealogy: Archer is a baseline for the proceduralisation of design under rising complexity (a dated benchmark for shift).  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** I use “shift” because Archer describes standards of judgement as built through precedent (case-law logic), fitting gradual movement rather than a single break. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 5]``  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will use Archer only where (1) “systematic” is defined without implying automation and (2) the method step implies a recordable inscription (brief/spec/model/diagram/criteria) that the DDR archive can surface. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, pp. 6, 8]``  

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Archer frames the booklet as revised articles from *Design* (1963–64) and notes appendices (checklist/arrow diagrams) as part of a continuing RCA study. He situates “systematic method” as a practical response to rising complexity and the cost of error in industrial work. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Archer presents systematisation as stabilising; I treat it as a historical move that also produces inscriptions (forms, diagrams, specs) that can later become infrastructural and shift. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``  

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to make designing more reliable under modern complexity by defining design as advance prescription/modelling and arguing for systematic (not necessarily automated) methods that clarify decision-making. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, pp. 6, 8]``  

## Lit review wiring (for copy/paste)
- **Lit review role:** Canonical baseline (S1) for the proceduralisation of design judgement into explicit method and “checkable” inscriptions.
- **1 sentence to paste into lit review:** Archer (1963) frames systematic method as a response to modern design complexity, defining designing through advance prescriptions/models and separating “systematic” from “automated,” which gives a dated baseline for tracing how method inscriptions become archival testaments that later shift. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, pp. 3, 6, 8]``

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Systematic design methods emerge because modern industrial design becomes too complex and too costly for rules-of-thumb; you cannot afford to be wrong.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Archer says design has become “immeasurably more complicated,” that rules-of-thumb no longer guide, and that (with tooling/industrial commitment) designers “cannot afford to be wrong”; he describes a “world wide shift … from the sculptural to the technological.” ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If error costs rise and the problem-space expands beyond tacit know-how, making process explicit becomes an epistemic requirement, not a stylistic choice.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** Archer provides an early, page-cited rationale for method as an epistemic response to complexity—usable as a baseline “testament” when testing later DDR records for shift in how design is justified and recorded. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``
- **Practice cross-check:** See **Archive hook (one)** below — TODO (add DDR record IDs).

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** Designing is the formulation of a prescription/model in advance of making; design knowledge is carried in representations.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Archer defines designing as “the formulation of a prescription or model for a finished work in advance of its embodiment,” distinguishing design from direct making. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 6]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If design is defined through prior representation, then those representations are legitimate epistemic evidence and should be treated as archival “testaments.”
- **So what for my thesis:** Archer gives a clean bridge from design epistemics to archival traces: the DDR archive can activate prescriptions/models as evidence of shift in criteria, method, and judgement over time. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 6]``
- **Practice cross-check:** See **Archive hook (one)** below — TODO (add DDR record IDs).

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** Being systematic is not the same as being automated; structuring the problem can make answers obvious without computation while leaving judgement with the designer.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Archer states that being systematic is “not necessarily synonymous with being automated,” and that preparing a problem for a computer can make the answer obvious to a skilled designer. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 8]``
- **Warrant (my words):** This keeps method-as-structure distinct from machine-as-authority—crucial for how I later frame computational reconstruction (S3).
- **So what for my thesis:** Archer lets me frame computational work as structure-revealing (not decision-making), keeping interpretive responsibility explicit and evidence-linked. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 8]``
- **Practice cross-check:** See **Archive hook (one)** below — TODO (add DDR record IDs).

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Systematic method:** A structured/logical way of setting out a problem; not identical with automation. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 8]``
- **Designing:** Formulating a prescription/model in advance of embodiment; designing is representational. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 6]``
- **Precedent (judgement over time):** Standards and value judgements grow through precedent, “in the manner of case law.” ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 5]``

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A clean historical justification for explicit method under complexity and cost (baseline for shift). ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``
  - A direct definition that makes representational artefacts legitimate epistemic evidence (archive-ready “testaments”). ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 6]``
  - A discipline rule for my thesis: systematic ≠ automated (guards my computational claims). ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 8]``
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will treat systematisation as producing inscriptions (checklists, diagrams, specs) that can later become infrastructural and shift as they circulate and get standardised. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - Which inscription formats (checklists/arrow diagrams in the appendices) become visible in DDR records, and how do they change across decades? ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Methods genealogy paragraph: complexity → method (p. 3); designing as advance prescription/model (p. 6); systematic ≠ automated (p. 8). ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, pp. 3, 6, 8]``
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention: *Systematic method for designers* (Archer 1963). Then Archer (1963) thereafter.
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** See **Archive hook (one)** below — TODO (add DDR record IDs).
- **Workstreams →** S1 methods genealogy; S2 inscription/record formats; S3 reconstruction framing
- **Deliverables →** Baseline paragraph for method genealogy; “prescription/model” definition anchor; interpretability framing sentence
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archive users; design research readers; examiners needing clear definitions and evidence chains

## Archive hook (one)
**Pick ONE DDR record set and test all three claims against it.**
- **Hook question:** Which DDR record(s) show method inscriptions (prescriptions/models, staged process, criteria) that function as “testamentary traces” of epistemic shift?
- **What to look for in DDR (attach archive IDs):**
  1) **Complexity justification** language (risk, cost, coordination) in briefs or institutional documents (Claim 1). ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``
  2) **Prescriptions/models**: specs, drawings, storyboards, typographic layouts, system diagrams (Claim 2). ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 6]``
  3) **Systematic-but-not-automated** framing in later computational/technical notes (Claim 3). ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 8]``
- **Output to write (1 sentence):** “In DDR record(s) ___, the testament appears as ___ (field/artefact), supporting Archer’s claim ___ and showing shift when compared to ___ (later standard/edition/record).”
- **TODO:** Add DDR record IDs: ___

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** Archer helps with the methods genealogy and representational definition of designing, but does not by itself provide an archival method for measuring shift without my evidence-chain procedure. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, pp. 3, 6, 8]``
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I treat Archer’s systematisation as a timeless programme, I flatten shift; I must use it as a dated baseline and show how later inscriptions and standards reshape what counts as evidence. ``[@Archer1963SystematicMethodDesigners, p. 3]``

# Chicago NB payload (capture what you’ll need later)
- **Key pages to reuse:** p. 3, 5, 6, 8
- **First full note (write it out here):** TODO (generate from bib entry once your Chicago NB pipeline formats it)
- **Short note form:** TODO
- **One quote worth lifting (≤2 lines):** “being systematic is not necessarily synonymous with being automated.” (p. 8)
- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** Designing is the advance formulation of a prescription/model; systematic method clarifies problems without surrendering judgement to machines (pp. 6, 8).

  - Cross (designerly knowing baseline; compare epistemic framing)
- What I will test or write next:
  - Pull 3 DDR records and test Archer’s three claims as “testaments” (one per decade). TODO
