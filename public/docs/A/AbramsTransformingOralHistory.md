This note focuses on Lynn Abrams’ chapter, ‘Transforming Oral History through Theory’, in Paul Thompson’s *The Voice of the Past: Oral History* (latest edition). It treats the chapter as a synthetic statement of “oral history theory”, emphasising how theoretical frameworks (memory studies, narrative, discourse, psychoanalysis, feminism, activism) reconfigure the practice and analysis of oral history. The aim is to extract a theory spine for the project’s oral-history strand, with particular attention to intersubjectivity, composure, power and activist/justice-oriented applications.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Abrams’ chapter addresses a methodological and theoretical question rather than a single empirical problem: how has the integration of theory transformed oral history from a largely pragmatic interviewing technique into a reflexive, interpretive field with its own conceptual toolkit [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast]?

Her objectives are to:
- show that oral history generates complex communicative events, not just factual content, and therefore demands theoretical analysis of *how* and *why* people speak as they do, not only *what* they say;
- trace how oral history has drawn on psychology, linguistics, literary studies, anthropology and feminist theory, as well as post-structuralism, to interpret memory narratives;
- demonstrate that concepts such as intersubjectivity, narrative structure, composure, coherence, cultural circuits, the unconscious and power have become central to reading oral history texts;
- explore the implications of this theoretical turn for activist, community and “restorative justice” projects, where testimony is bound up with identity, trauma and politics [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast].

The chapter thus reframes oral history as a theoretically informed, interpretive practice where interviews are analysed as performances and texts embedded in social, cultural and political contexts.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

The chapter is a conceptual and synthetic essay rather than an empirical study with a defined sample. Its “method” is interpretive literature review and exemplification:

- **Sources.** Abrams draws on:
  - major oral history projects and case studies (for example, Julie Cruikshank’s work in Yukon, Daniel James’ study of Doña María, Alistair Thomson’s Gallipoli veteran “Fred” and his work with migrants, community projects and truth-and-reconciliation settings);
  - theoretical contributions from narrative studies, memory studies, psychoanalysis, feminist theory, discourse analysis and cultural studies;
  - her own fieldwork and narrative analyses, including Shetland women’s stories and interviews with British women born in the 1940s [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast].

- **Analytic approach.** She uses close reading of narrative excerpts and projects to illustrate the analytical value of theoretical concepts: narrative structure and genre, performance, life story versus life history, composure, coherence systems, cultural circuits, psychic shaping of memory, power and “sharing authority”.

- **Design and sample.** There is no discrete sample size or formal research design. Instead, Abrams curates an illustrative repertoire of projects from different contexts (indigenous communities, working-class communities, gender and migration, post-conflict societies) to demonstrate how theory reorients interpretation.

The chapter therefore functions as a methodological and theoretical map for oral historians seeking to integrate theory into every stage of practice, from interviewing to interpretation.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Theory has transformed oral history from content extraction to interpretive analysis.**

   Abrams argues that oral history began as a practical method for obtaining information about the past but quickly revealed itself as a complex communicative event. What is said is only one element of significance; how and why it is said, and in what context, are equally crucial [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast]. The “theoretical turn” from the 1970s onwards arose when historians recognised that traditional empiricist tools were insufficient to unpack meaning from dense, multi-layered narratives.

   She shows how oral historians turned to psychology, linguistics, literary studies, anthropology and feminist theory—underpinned by post-structuralism—to understand subjectivity, discourse and the multiply constructed self. From this eclectic borrowing emerged a body of “oral history theory” in its own right, particularly within memory and narrative studies, which are now central to the oral historian’s toolkit [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast].

2. **Narrative, composure and intersubjectivity are core analytical lenses.**

   Abrams stresses that interviews produce *life stories* rather than simple *life histories*: creative, selective, sometimes non-linear narratives through which individuals make sense of their pasts. These stories draw on available cultural scripts and genres—epic, romance, confession—and are framed to produce a coherent, composed self in relation to others.

   Key theoretical concepts include:
   - **Composure (Graham Dawson).** Narrators seek narrative forms that align personal experience with culturally available meanings, creating a sense of comfort and coherence. Individual testimony thus becomes an entry point into dominant or contested cultural discourses.
   - **Coherence systems (Charlotte Linde).** Narrators employ overarching belief systems or values (for example, gender equality in feminist-inflected narratives) to make their lives narratable and intelligible, and to anchor identity.
   - **Cultural circuits/feedback loops (Richard Johnson).** Personal stories draw on public representations and, in turn, feed back into the public sphere, making it hazardous simply to “read off” culture from individual accounts.
   - **Intersubjectivity.** Interviews are co-produced; the interview relationship, shared or divergent positions, and the performance of voice, gesture and emotion shape what is told and how it is told [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast].

   These perspectives move oral history analysis beyond checking factual accuracy towards exploring how people compose selves and histories in relation to culture, power and audience.

3. **Power, activism and justice complicate the promise of “giving voice”.**

   Abrams also highlights the ways theory has sharpened awareness of power asymmetries and the political uses of oral history. Early community projects often imagined oral history as inherently democratic or emancipatory, “giving voice” to marginalised groups. Theoretical work on power, subjectivity and institutions complicates this optimism.

   She explores:
   - **Sharing authority.** Collaborative projects where narrators participate in design, interpretation and authorship can produce richer, more nuanced accounts but do not automatically dissolve structural inequalities.
   - **Activist oral history.** Community and migrant projects use oral history as a tool for identity construction, group cohesion and policy advocacy. Testimony is not just data but part of an ongoing politics of recognition.
   - **Restorative justice and witnessing.** Truth and reconciliation processes and post-conflict testimonies show both the potential and the risks of institutionalised “bearing witness”. Speaking can be empowering but may also retraumatise or leave structural injustices untouched if not supported by legal and material remedies [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast].

   Overall, theory reveals that oral history is never a neutral conduit of experience. It is a site where identities, memories and power relations are negotiated, sometimes reproduced and sometimes contested.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

For a project that uses oral history to interrogate institutional histories and epistemic drift, Abrams supplies the theoretical grammar to treat interviews as interpretive, co-constructed texts rather than transparent reports of events.

- **Epistemic stance.** The chapter reinforces a view of oral histories as sites where narrators negotiate composure, coherence and identity in relation to institutional narratives and broader discourses. This aligns with a research focus on how “what happened” is continuously rewritten through memory, narrative and institutional storytelling [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast].
- **Theoretical integration.** Abrams embeds memory studies, narrative analysis, feminist and psychoanalytic perspectives within oral history. These frameworks can anchor the project’s interpretation of interviews with institutional actors, especially around paradoxes, silences and contradictions in their accounts.
- **Power and participation.** Her discussion of sharing authority, activist oral history and justice-oriented projects provides conceptual tools for designing participatory elements, handling ethical risks, and framing the political implications of recording and publishing institutional testimonies.

The chapter therefore connects directly to the project’s concern with the politics of institutional memory, the design of interpretive infrastructures, and the integration of oral history into a multi-method research spine.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- **Justifies a theoretically informed reading of interviews.** Abrams argues that interviews must be analysed using concepts such as composure, narrative genre, coherence systems and cultural circuits, rather than treated as raw factual input [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast]. This supports the project’s intention to read institutional oral histories through explicit theoretical lenses, not merely code them thematically.
- **Provides operational concepts for analysis.** Composure, coherence systems, intersubjectivity and cultural circuits can be translated into analytic codes, memo headings or model dimensions. They give the project a vocabulary for describing how narrators align (or fail to align) their experiences with institutional narratives and cultural scripts.
- **Foregrounds power and collaboration as design considerations.** The discussion of sharing authority and activist oral history underlines the need to design interview processes, consent frameworks and dissemination practices that acknowledge power imbalances and make space for co-interpretation where appropriate [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast].
- **Clarifies limits of “voice” in institutional and justice contexts.** The nuanced treatment of restorative justice and truth commissions cautions against assuming that testimony is automatically empowering or reparative. This is crucial for a project that may invite narrators to revisit past conflicts, failures or exclusions within an institution.
- **Supports triangulation of personal and collective narratives.** Abrams’ emphasis on personal stories as shaped by, and shaping, public discourses reinforces the project’s plan to triangulate oral histories with archives, media and institutional documents, interpreting alignments and disjunctures as evidence about institutional memory and drift.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Clear articulation of “oral history theory”.** Abrams synthesises disparate strands—memory, narrative, performance, composure, psychoanalysis, activism—into a coherent account of how theory has reshaped practice. This makes the chapter an efficient gateway into the field’s conceptual debates [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast].
- **Analytic richness.** The use of concrete case studies demonstrates how theoretical tools yield deeper readings of interviews than content-focused approaches. This is methodologically instructive for designing analytic strategies.
- **Attention to power and politics.** The chapter does not romanticise “giving voice”; it interrogates power relations in academic, community and justice-oriented projects, addressing exploitation, collaboration and the risks of witnessing.
- **Embeddedness of theory in practice.** Abrams insists that theory is not an abstract overlay but is “deeply embedded” in all stages of oral history work. This reinforces the project’s aim to integrate theory into methods, not bolt it on at the end.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Selective geography and examples.** The examples lean heavily towards Euro-American and settler-colonial contexts, with some global extension. For an institutionally specific project, further work will be needed to think through how these frameworks travel across different cultural and organisational settings.
- **Limited engagement with digital and computational contexts.** The chapter predates, or only lightly touches on, questions about digital platforms, online interviewing, data protection and computational analysis (for example, NLP or multimodal retrieval). These require supplementation.
- **Asymmetry between theory and method detail.** While the theoretical synthesis is rich, there is less step-by-step guidance on operationalising these concepts in coding, modelling or tool design. The project must therefore translate high-level theory into practical schemas.
- **Underdeveloped link to design research.** The chapter is framed within history and allied disciplines, with little explicit engagement with design research or practice-led inquiry. Additional bridging work is needed to align these theoretical tools with designerly modes of knowing.

### Author’s credibility
- Lynn Abrams is a leading oral historian and theorist, Professor of Modern History, and author of *Oral History Theory*, a key text in the field. Her dual role as practitioner and theorist, and her sustained engagement with gender, community and narrative, mean that her synthesis carries significant weight within oral history and memory studies [@Thompson2017VoiceOfThePast]. Her authority is further reinforced by the chapter’s placement in Thompson’s canonical *The Voice of the Past*.

### Contextual validity
- The frameworks Abrams discusses—narrative, composure, intersubjectivity, power—are widely used across oral history and have been applied in diverse settings. They generalise beyond the specific case studies, providing a flexible conceptual toolkit.
- Nonetheless, the chapter’s assumptions (for example, about confessional cultures, feminist discourse, truth commissions) are grounded mainly in late-20th- and early-21st-century contexts. Application to contemporary digital, hybrid or highly bureaucratised institutional settings requires further contextualisation.
- The emphasis on individual life stories and community projects may require adaptation when working with organisational elites or technical professionals whose narrative repertoires and institutional constraints differ from those of typical community-history projects.

### Comparisons
- Relative to Yow’s *Recording Oral History* [@Yow2005RecordingOralHistory], which focuses on practice, ethics and project design, Abrams is more explicitly theoretical and less procedural. Yow offers the “how”; Abrams offers a sophisticated account of the “how to think about what one has collected”.
- Compared with Ritchie’s *Doing Oral History* [@Ritchie2014DoingOralHistory], Abrams devotes far more attention to narrative theory, composure, psychoanalysis and activism. Ritchie remains more strongly anchored in institutional practice and documentation standards.
- Abrams’ treatment of narrative and composure complements Alessandro Portelli’s emphasis on meaning over factual accuracy, offering additional language (composure, coherence systems, cultural circuits) to interpret why stories are told as they are.
- In relation to Michael Roper’s psychoanalytic approaches, Abrams situates the unconscious as one among several important lenses. She acknowledges its value while maintaining a broader, multi-theoretical stance.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- **Alternative explanations.** Abrams’ narrative could be read as part of a wider disciplinary negotiation: oral historians leveraging theory to claim intellectual legitimacy within the academy, away from the perception of oral history as “mere” testimony collection. This frames the theoretical turn both as genuine epistemic enrichment and as a politics of disciplinary status.
- **Implications for practice, policy and theory.** For the project, the key implication is that every design decision—who is interviewed, how questions are framed, how transcripts are processed, how excerpts are presented—is also a theoretical move. Treating interviews as life stories shaped by composure, coherence and intersubjectivity encourages reading institutional testimony as negotiated, not given.
- **Shaping project thinking.** The chapter pushes the project:
  - to move systematically from “what was said” to “how and why it was said in that way, in that context, to that interviewer”;
  - to treat divergences, silences and disjointed narratives as evidence of discomposure or contested cultural scripts, particularly around institutional change and failure;
  - to design opportunities for collaboration or feedback with narrators, while remaining realistic about structural limits on “sharing authority” in institutional research.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase — verified against Abrams (2017, pp. 172–181)

1. “Oral history is a practical method for obtaining information about the past by means of conducting an interview, but in the process of eliciting and analysing the material collected, researchers quickly understood that what was said was just one element in a complex communicative event.” (p. 172)

2. “Paying attention to how and why something is said provides access to the meaning of the words expressed.” (p. 172)

3. “The very practice of doing oral history has resulted in the development and elaboration of a range of innovative theoretical models and applications … Oral history, then, has spawned its own theory so that we can now speak of ‘oral history theory’ as a distinct field.” (p. 173)

4. “The now commonplace acknowledgement of the significance of the intersubjective relations between the parties to an interview—the acceptance that there is no such thing as an unmediated narrative—came about as oral historians observed the impact of this social interaction on the ways in which respondents constructed a narrative.” (p. 174)

5. “Theory has transformed the ways we analyse and interpret oral history narratives, allowing us to move beyond content alone towards a better and deeper appreciation of the underlying significance of what is said.” (p. 174)

6. **Paraphrase:** Abrams explains that oral historians turned to psychology, linguistics, literary studies, anthropology, and feminist theory—underpinned by post-structuralism—to find interpretive tools capable of unpacking the meanings embedded in complex, socially constructed narratives. (pp. 172–173)

7. **Paraphrase:** She argues that the recognition of memory as “mutable and reflexive” emerged partly from oral history practice itself, as researchers sought to understand silences, slips, and selectivity in recall. (p. 173)

8. **Paraphrase:** Abrams develops intersubjectivity as a defining concept: interviews are shaped by the relationship between interviewer and narrator, whose dialogue determines both form and content. (p. 174)

9. “So what might seem like a series of stories or memories which do not seem to cohere … can be made ‘interpretable’ by accepting the ‘essential artfulness’ of oral narratives and then using appropriate interpretive models to make sense of the narrative.” (p. 177)

10. “Community oral history and projects that work with disenfranchised groups are more likely to use oral history methods as a means of enhancing group identity … This has been termed activist oral history.” (p. 180)

## Questions for further research
- How can concepts such as composure, coherence systems and cultural circuits be operationalised in coding schemes and computational models (for example, tagging segments that align with dominant versus counter-narratives)?
- What does “sharing authority” look like in a design-research context where the researcher also acts as an organiser of digital infrastructures and visualisations?
- How might Abrams’ insights about trauma, witnessing and justice inform protocols for interviewing institutional actors about conflict, failure or exclusion, where harms may be more diffuse and reputational than physically violent?
- How do digital media and online platforms alter the dynamics of composure, intersubjectivity and cultural circuits in institutional memory-making?
- To what extent can activist oral history practices be adapted to institutional settings without collapsing into public-relations exercises or managerial storytelling?
