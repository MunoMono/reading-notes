# Scope of this note
Short Science Policy Forum piece (three pages, 1192–1194). Read here as an infrastructural and governance statement about *global scientific collections* — how to describe, aggregate and strategically extend them — with clear resonance for DDR as a smaller, institutional “collection as data”.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

The article asks:

- How can the world’s natural history museum collections be **conceptually mapped and coordinated** as a single “global collection”?
- What **methods and infrastructural moves** are needed to understand coverage and gaps at scale, and to make these collections usable for climate, biodiversity and societal decision-making? (pp. 1192–1193)

The stated aim is to propose a **simple, rapid method** to assess the contents of any natural history museum, report initial results for 73 of the world’s largest museums and herbaria, and outline a **roadmap** for activating and integrating this “global collection” for future use. 

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

- **Scope:** 73 of the world’s largest natural history museums and herbaria across 28 countries (p. 1192). [oai_citation:2‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  
- **Data collected:**
  - Total specimen/object counts per institution, summing to **1,147,934,687** objects.  
  - Estimates (to the nearest order of magnitude) of holdings broken down by **19 collection types × 16 geographic regions**, creating a 304-cell grid. Each museum’s holdings in one cell = a “collection unit”  
  - Proportion of objects with digitally discoverable records and genomic data (16% and 0.2% respectively) 
  - Workforce size and age distribution: ~4500 science staff and nearly 4000 volunteers across the 73 institutions 
- **Technique:** expert elicitation rather than item-level counting — curators estimate counts per collection unit “to the nearest order of magnitude”, producing a coarse but rapid map of holdings (most museums finished within two weeks)  

The paper also synthesises **existing infrastructures and standards** (GBIF, TDWG, FAIR, CARE, ALA, iDigBio, etc.) as contextual background 

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Natural history collections form a vast but largely “dark” global infrastructure.**  
   - Over three centuries, museums have accumulated a **global collection** that is “the physical basis for our understanding of the natural world and our place in it” and directly relevant to issues from conservation to pandemics (p. 1192). [oai_citation:8‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  
   - Yet “most natural history museum data are not digitally discoverable”; only **16%** of surveyed objects have digital records and only **0.2%** have accessible genomic records, leaving the majority as *“dark data”* (p. 1192). [oai_citation:9‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  

2. **A simple shared grid (collection type × region) can make holdings and gaps visible.**  
   - By developing a common vocabulary of **19 collection types** and **16 geographic source areas**, the authors show that “any collection object from anywhere in the world would fall into only one of the resulting 304 cells” (p. 1192). [oai_citation:10‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  
   - Using curator-estimated counts, they generate a **heat map of 1957 collection units with >10,000 objects**, revealing focal areas and conspicuous absences (e.g. tropical and polar regions, marine systems, arthropod and microbial diversity) (pp. 1192–1194). [oai_citation:11‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  

3. **Colonial concentration and underinvestment produce structural gaps.**  
   - The largest collections are concentrated in **European and North American cities**, a pattern that “remains a major barrier to connecting much of the world with its natural heritage, exacerbating the societal wrongs of colonial history in museum science” (p. 1193).
   - Collections and expertise are threatened by fires, disasters, conflict and “long-term underinvestment in infrastructure and expertise” (p. 1193).

4. **Digitisation, genomics, informatics and capacity building are key levers.**  
   - The authors propose four strategic pillars:  
     1. **Digitisation** through high-throughput pipelines (e.g. conveyor belts imaging >6000 herbarium sheets per day).  
     2. **Genomic collections** coordinated with EBP and GGBN (including frozen gametes and stem cells).  
     3. **Informatics** to link and illuminate collections in open platforms (extended digital specimens).  
     4. **Training and capacity building** to democratise access to technologies and expertise (p. 1193).
5. **Ethics, Indigenous data governance and shared stewardship are central.**  
   - Many objects were collected without consent, permissions or recognition of contributors; museums must now “engage with source communities” and handle sensitive cultural and ecological knowledge carefully (p. 1194). =
   - The paper references **CARE** principles and notes emerging practices of **shared stewardship**, repatriation and benefit-sharing (pp. 1192–1194). 

6. **Museums should function as a networked, global science infrastructure.**  
   - The authors call for “a new age of networked museums” whose goal is to “exceed the sum of their parts” through strategic collecting, digitisation and integration (p. 1194). 
   - Smaller regional collections are emphasised as vital for bridging global gaps and providing local context; integrating them is framed as a way to “elevate marginalized voices” in training and careers (p. 1194).

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

- Offers a **worked example of collections-as-data governance** at planetary scale: classification grid, interoperability, digitisation, FAIR/CARE-based infrastructure.
- Provides terminology and legitimacy for treating DDR as **scientific infrastructure** rather than a mere historical residue: DDR can be framed as a small but dense collection whose integration, digitisation and documentation matter for research futures.
- Highlights **colonial concentration, dark data and underinvestment**, which parallel DDR’s own partialness and institutional constraints, though on a different scale.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Grid as schema precedent.**  
  The 19×16 collection-type/region matrix is a concrete example of a **shared, coarse schema** that makes heterogeneous holdings and gaps legible (p. 1192). This directly supports DDR’s emerging core/residual/extended schema: a deliberately simple structure that still surfaces coverage and absence.

- **Dark data and digitisation incentives.**  
  The claim that only **16%** of surveyed objects have digital records and only **0.2%** genomic records (p. 1192) underlines the scale of “dark data” in cultural/scientific collections and justifies DDR’s focus on making its own records digitally discoverable.

- **Ethical and political framing.**  
  The acknowledgment that collection concentration in Europe/North America “exacerbat[es] the societal wrongs of colonial history” and that many objects were collected without consent (pp. 1192–1194) gives a Science-endorsed precedent for aligning DDR infrastructure design with CARE-style, community-sensitive principles.

- **Networked infrastructure vision.**  
  The call for “a new age of networked museums” and extended digital specimens (pp. 1192–1194) supports the vision of DDR as part of a wider network of design-research archives and linked-data resources.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Clear, quantitative overview.**  
  Provides hard numbers (1.15 billion objects; 16% digitised; 0.2% genomic) and a reproducible grid method for rapid assessment (p. 1192). [oai_citation:19‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  
- **Integrates infrastructure, ethics and policy.**  
  Ties GBIF/TDWG/FAIR/CARE to strategic collecting, climate frameworks and Indigenous data governance in three dense pages (pp. 119)–1194]. [oai_citation:20‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  
- **Science venue and large coalition.**  
  The Global Collection Group and Science publication confer political weight; the article can be cited to justify infrastructural investment.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Very coarse-grained method.**  
  Order-of-magnitude estimates and 19×16 cells are pragmatic but flatten nuance; internal heterogeneities and metadata quality are not captured (p. 1192). [oai_citation:21‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  
- **Focus on natural history, not design/archives.**  
  Translation to DDR requires analogy; the article does not address design archives, textual records or born-digital material.
- **Limited engagement with socio-technical failure modes.**  
  Dark data are mentioned, but there is little detail on how infrastructures might reproduce bias or silence beyond colonial geography.

### Author’s credibility
- Kirk Johnson is Director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Owens is associated with Cornell Lab of Ornithology; the **Global Collection Group** encompasses major institutions. This, plus publication in *Science*, positions the piece as an authoritative, agenda-setting statement.

### Contextual validity
- The framework is tailored to natural history but generalises conceptually: **shared vocabularies, registries, digitisation pipelines and global networks** are relevant to any distributed collection.
- Numerical estimates are specific to the 73 surveyed institutions but illustrate orders of magnitude rather than exact totals.

### Comparisons
- **With Gooding (critically addressable data):** Johnson et al. sketch the macro side (global coverage, registries); Gooding dives into making individual collections technically “addressable”.
- **With FAIR and PADILLA / Shorish (collections as data):** Johnson et al. operate in the same normative space but emphasise *strategic collecting* and **gap-filling** as much as data reuse.
- **With Johnson et al. vs DDR:** DDR becomes a micro-case mirroring the same issues: dark data, partial digitisation, underinvestment, need for shared schema and registries.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- The key transferable idea is the **grid as infrastructural simplification**: DDR can be treated as a small-scale equivalent, with a limited set of document/entity types × institutional dimensions (e.g. department, time period) used to map holdings and gaps.
- The article legitimises a **collections-as-infrastructure** argument in a high-profile venue, which the thesis can appropriate to argue that DDR is not just a historical curiosity but a research and policy asset whose (re)infrastructure matters.
- The emphasis on ethics and colonial concentration provides scaffolding for folding in **data feminism / CARE** arguments when dealing with whose work and voices DDR represents.

### Alternative explanations?
- One might attribute gaps purely to resource shortages; Johnson et al. stress that **colonial histories and geographic concentration** also structure what is collected and where expertise sits (p. 1193). [oai_citation:22‡Johnson et al. - 2023 - A global approach for natural history museum collections.pdf]  

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?
- **Practice:** model DDR holdings using a small matrix, assess coverage and “dark” segments, and prioritise digitisation accordingly.
- **Policy:** draw on Johnson et al. when arguing for investment in DDR infrastructure, framing it as part of a broader global move toward integrated collections.
- **Theory:** use the paper to bridge between archival description standards (ISAD(G), provenance) and **collections-as-data thinking**, showing how coarse infrastructural models can coexist with rich item-level metadata.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “Taken as a whole, this global collection is the physical basis for our understanding of the natural world and our place in it, an unparalleled source of information…” (p. 1192) (p. 1192). 
- “Only 16% of the objects have digitally discoverable records, and only 0.2% of biological collections have accessible genomic records.” (p. 1192). 
- **Paraphrase:** By creating a shared vocabulary of 19 collection types and 16 geographic regions, the authors produce a 304-cell grid in which any collection object falls into exactly one cell, allowing rapid, order-of-magnitude mapping of holdings and gaps. (p. 1192) 
- “The concentration of the largest collections in European and North American cities remains a major barrier to connecting much of the world with its natural heritage, exacerbating the societal wrongs of colonial history in museum science.” (p. 1193)
- **Paraphrase:** Many historical collection practices no longer meet contemporary standards for social and environmental justice; museums must work with source communities around objects and associated metadata, including sensitive cultural and ecological knowledge, and pursue shared stewardship and benefit-sharing. (p. 1194) 
- “The natural history museums of the world all hold portions of the global collection, a fact that argues for a new age of networked museums whose goal is to exceed the sum of their parts…” (p. 1194) (p. 1194).

## Questions for further research
- How might a **Johnson-style grid** be adapted to DDR (e.g. document type × department/decade) to visualise gaps and guide digitisation?
- What would a **GRSciColl-equivalent registry** look like for design research archives, and how might DDR participate?
- How can FAIR and CARE principles be concretely operationalised for DDR’s hybrid of administrative records, theses, and design artefacts?
- What forms of **shared stewardship** and community engagement are appropriate when DDR records touch on communities beyond the RCA (industry partners, collaborators, research participants)?
