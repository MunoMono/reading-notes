# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** Because Jonas offers a compact “mapping” logic for design research that helps me specify what counts as epistemiv shift/shift inside design methods (and what does not). [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 1]  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Lit review / Methods genealogy: it lets me say that design research cannot be reduced to “science applied to design”, and that the observer’s involvement changes what “research” means in design. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, pp. 12–13]  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** Jonas helps separate “design knowledge” from truth/false claims and frames it as fit, variation, and learning cycles; that gives me a cleaner basis for “drift” than vague “change” language. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 2]  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will only use Jonas when I can tie a claim to (1) a specific process/learning model and (2) an explicit observer position (for/about/through). [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, pp. 12–13]

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Jonas writes from design research’s “methodology and epistemology” debates, trying to stabilise what design research is when it is neither conventional science nor “mere” practice. He treats design as inherently hybrid (science + non-science; fuzzy + outdated + missing knowledge), and frames the field’s problem as how to stay rigorous without pretending design can be made fully predictive. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, pp. 1–2]  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Jonas is still mainly working through a familiar canon (Jones, Archer, Simon, Schön, etc.). My job is to treat this mapping as a historical “testament” and then test it against the DDR archive’s material record (editions, teaching scripts, institutional paperwork). [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, pp. 11–13]

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to define a workable logic for design research by modelling it as a cybernetic learning process (analysis–projection–synthesis) and by distinguishing research for/about/through design via the observer’s position. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, pp. 12–13]

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Design knowledge is not “true/false” in the scientific sense; it is about producing new fits under changing conditions, using mixed and sometimes fuzzy knowledge.  
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Jonas contrasts science’s need for stable predictive models with design’s need to create variation because “fits” dissolve and contexts change; he frames design knowledge as a memory-like “reservoir of variations” and treats “informed intuition” as core, not a defect. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 2]  
- **Warrant (my words):** If design operates by generating and selecting fits rather than verifying stable truths, then “valid knowledge” in design drifts with environments, users, and institutional conditions. That is exactly the terrain where epistemiv shift becomes visible.  
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** I treat epistemiv shift in design research as a change in what counts as a “good fit” and what kinds of knowledge are permitted to justify it. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 2]  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR example where criteria for “good design research” changes across syllabi / briefs / assessment sheets)

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** “Research through design” is an integrative logic: the design process (not the scientific process) should guide design research, with “projection” doing the key joining work.  
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Jonas argues the emerging RTD paradigm treats the generic design process as the guide, embeds the scientific paradigm inside the design paradigm, and insists complexity must not be reduced without destroying the subject matter; he then states RTD’s integrative function is in the “projection” phase linking design and scientific research. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, pp. 11–12]  
- **Warrant (my words):** If projection integrates science and design, then epistemiv shift can be tracked at the junction where evidence standards are translated into design concepts (and back again).  
- **So what for my thesis:** I can operationalise “testament” as the trace of projection decisions (what gets carried across the seam between science-language and design-language). [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 12]  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (identify “projection traces” in DDR archive: briefs, critiques, revisions, cataloguing notes)

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** The strongest distinction in design research is not subject matter but observer involvement; “for/about/through” map onto first- and second-order cybernetic positions.  
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Jonas states disciplinary subject distinctions “do not make sense” for design research and proposes distinctions based on observer positions; he links this to the move from first- to second-order cybernetics and uses it to ground research FOR / ABOUT / THROUGH design (and an “inaccessible” category). [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 13]  
- **Warrant (my words):** If observer position is the organising principle, then a drift/shift can be evidenced by institutions moving (explicitly or implicitly) between these positions (e.g., from “about” to “for”, or claiming “through” without accepting involvement).  
- **So what for my thesis:** I will read DDR archival documents as positioning statements: they tell me whether the archive frames knowledge as “about”, “for”, or “through” design, and where that framing changes over time. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 13]  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR cataloguing / teaching documents that encode “about/for/through” assumptions)

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Projection:** the phase that bridges analysis and synthesis and integrates science and design in RTD (my use: “where translation happens”; the likely site of testamentary traces). [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 12]  
- **Research THROUGH design (RTD):** research guided by the design process, aimed at transferable knowledge and innovation, where observer involvement matters. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 13]

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A clean, teachable mapping device: triadic process + observer-position categories. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, pp. 11–13]  
  - A justification for treating “intuition/muddling through” as legitimate *when* it is made accountable through process models and traces. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 2]  
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will treat Jonas’s mapping as a historical scaffold, then test it against the DDR archive’s documentary evidence (where the institution actually placed the observer and what it recorded as “evidence”). [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 13]  
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What are the DDR archive’s own “projection” artefacts (the documents where science-talk becomes design decisions), and how are they described/catalogued? [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 12]

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Literature review section “From design science to cybernetic learning models” (set up my definition of drift/shift as changes in criteria + observer position). [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, pp. 2, 13]  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention: “Wolfgang Jonas’s ‘Exploring the Swampy Ground: An inquiry into the logic of design research’ (2012)…” [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 1]  
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO (DDR item where research is framed as “about” design; compare later item claiming “through”)  
- **Workstreams →** S1 canon mapping; bridge to S2 via “testament/projection traces”  
- **Deliverables →** A one-page schema: (triad phases) × (observer positions) with DDR document examples  
- **Stakeholders →** TODO (RCA DDR archive staff / programme leads / cataloguers)

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** Jonas gives a meta-model of design research logic; he does not, by himself, supply institutional evidence of how archives record (or distort) that logic. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 13]  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I use Jonas as a universal template, I will force the DDR archive to “fit” his categories and miss drift that shows up in record-keeping practices, omissions, and classification choices. [@Jonas2012ExploringSwampyGround, p. 2]

## Constraints check
- **Missing page cites:** None in the three claims; TODO remains only where a direct “quote worth lifting” was requested.  
- **Drift from RQ / strand:** Kept to S1 (canon + design research epistemology). Any move into S2 (record-keeping) is framed as a *next step* via “projection traces”, not as evidence claimed from Jonas.  
- **Bloat flags:** If this feels long in practice, cut “Position + moment” to 2 lines and keep only one bullet under “My response”.
