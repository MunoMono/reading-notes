# Scope of this note
Focuses on Portelli’s methodological introduction and the essay “The Death of Luigi Trastulli,” which together establish the interpretive turn in oral history: from factual accuracy to meaning-making. The note connects these arguments to the DDR oral-history strand, showing how narrative inconsistency and subjectivity become evidence of epistemic drift and institutional memory.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Portelli asks what historians can learn from the *differences* between oral narratives and documentary records. He challenges the assumption that inconsistencies invalidate testimony, arguing instead that “errors, inventions and myths” reveal how individuals and communities interpret historical experience. His purpose is to redefine oral history as a meaning-making practice—an epistemology of interpretation rather than verification.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
Portelli bases his analysis on interviews conducted with workers and residents in Terni, Italy, concerning the 1949 death of Luigi Trastulli, a steelworker killed during a protest. The oral accounts diverge sharply from newspaper and union reports, shifting the event’s date and context. Portelli performs a qualitative comparison between official documentation and personal recollections, treating the distortions themselves as analytical data. His approach is hermeneutic: he reads memory as a text that encodes emotion, class identity and cultural meaning.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Meaning over fact.** The value of oral history lies not in factual precision but in how people construct and assign meaning to the past.  
2. **Memory as narrative.** Recollection operates through symbolic and collective frameworks that reveal emotional truths.  
3. **Discrepancy as data.** Divergences between memory and record are not flaws but indicators of social consciousness and identity.  
4. **Historian as interpreter.** Oral history transforms the historian’s role from verifier to translator of meaning.  
5. **Shared authority.** The interview is a site of co-authorship; knowledge arises through dialogue and reciprocity.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
Portelli’s theory of “meaning over fact” directly supports the project’s epistemological stance that **drift is method, not error**. His approach legitimises the DDR oral-history component as interpretive evidence, complementing computational data with subjective narrative. Just as Portelli reads discrepancy as cultural insight, the DDR project reads archival contradictions—between categories, classifications and recollections—as epistemic material rather than administrative noise.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Validates **oral testimony as interpretive evidence**, allowing DDR interviews to stand alongside archival and computational data (pp. 1–10).  
- Justifies **discrepancy as method**: narrative distortion becomes a form of knowledge about institutional and cultural identity (pp. 26–28).  
- Reinforces the **ethics of representation**—recognising narrators as co-authors whose memory co-constructs the archive (pp. 30–34).  
- Provides theoretical precedent for **reflexive classification**, where contradiction and drift are productive epistemic forces.  

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Qualitative analysis; oral-history integration; epistemic drift.  
- **Deliverables →** Interview transcripts indexed within the DDR taxonomy as relational data.  
- **Stakeholders →** Oral-history participants; archivists; design-historians interpreting memory as infrastructure.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Pioneering redefinition of oral history as interpretive rather than positivist.  
- Offers a transferable methodological framework applicable to design, archival and computational contexts.  
- Provides clear ethical implications: acknowledges subjectivity and co-authorship as intrinsic to historical practice.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- The argument may underplay the role of power in shaping which memories survive.  
- Focuses heavily on a single case study (Terni); generalisation requires interpretive care.  
- Does not address how digital media might transform oral narrative forms.

### Author’s credibility
Alessandro Portelli (b. 1942) is an Italian oral historian, literary critic and professor at Sapienza University, Rome. His methodological innovations have defined the field; this book established him as the leading theorist of narrative meaning in oral history.

### Contextual validity
Portelli’s interpretive model extends far beyond historical sociology. It applies to any field where meaning is co-produced—especially design research, where practice and recollection overlap. His framework is directly translatable to qualitative computational historiography.

### Comparisons
Complements Thompson (2017) on the moral and participatory function of oral history. Expands Frisch’s (1990) “shared authority” into a phenomenological account of memory. Anticipates Ritchie (2011) and Perks & Thomson (2016) on the methodological pluralism of contemporary oral-history practice.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Portelli reframes accuracy as a secondary concern: the historian’s task is not to reconcile inconsistencies but to understand why they exist. The shifting recollections of Trastulli’s death exemplify how memory negotiates trauma and collective identity. For the DDR project, this provides a qualitative analogue to computational drift—both describe systems that evolve through error and reinterpretation. Memory’s instability becomes evidence of design research’s own unstable epistemology.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory
- Establishes **qualitative validity** grounded in meaning and affect.  
- Encourages **interpretive ethics** in computational systems: discrepancies in data, like in memory, can reveal structure rather than failure.  
- Suggests that oral histories should be indexed as **semantic events** within digital archives—expressing the process of remembering as part of the data model.  

### How does it shape your thinking?
Portelli shifts the project’s understanding of testimony from supplement to system. Interviews with former DDR members become generative tools for re-mapping institutional knowledge. His work provides the theoretical bridge between narrative subjectivity and computational reflexivity—affirming that uncertainty and contradiction are the true engines of insight.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “Errors, inventions and myths lead us through and beyond facts to their meanings.” (p. 2)  
- “Memory is not a passive depository of facts, but an active process of creation of meanings.” (p. 27)  
- **Paraphrase:** Portelli argues that discrepancies between oral accounts and documentary records are not distortions but expressions of cultural and emotional truth, revealing how communities make sense of experience. (pp. 25–30)

## Questions for further research
- How can Portelli’s interpretive framework inform computational models of oral testimony in archives?  
- Can AI-driven transcription tools capture nuance, hesitation and affect—the very features Portelli values as meaning?  
- What happens when discrepancies between memory and metadata are made visible through design visualisation—can contradiction itself be rendered as interface?
