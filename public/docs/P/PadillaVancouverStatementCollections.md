# Scope of this note
Use the Vancouver Statement to frame DDR materials as *collections-as-data* with an explicit ethical, social-justice and infrastructural lens, especially around AI, data sovereignty, climate and labour.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

- To update the earlier Santa Barbara Statement in light of broader global uptake of collections-as-data and an increasingly complex data/AI landscape. (p.1)
- To articulate a **set of principles** for responsible development, access and computational use of collections-as-data across GLAM and related communities. (pp.1–2)    
- To empower “memory, knowledge and data stewards” to navigate ethical, legal and infrastructural questions around collections-as-data work. (p.1)  

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

- Normative **statement of principles**, not empirical research.  
- Builds on prior community work (Santa Barbara Statement) and subsequent international practice in collections-as-data. (p.1)
- Synthesises debates around ethics, equity, Indigenous data sovereignty, interoperability, AI/ML, climate impact and labour into **11 high-level principles**. (pp.2–4)

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Collections-as-data are about responsible computational use**  
   - Any digital material can potentially be provided as data amenable to computation, but access and licensing must be designed with community needs and ethical concerns in mind. (pp.1–2)

2. **Equity, ethics and context are central, not add-ons**  
   - Principles stress working against historic and contemporary inequities; foreground Indigenous data governance (e.g. CARE, Māori Data Sovereignty); and require documentation of silences, biases and risks to vulnerable communities. (pp.2–3, Principle 2) 

3. **Infrastructure, labour, AI and environment must be accounted for**  
   - Calls for attention to participatory design, documentation, interoperability (social and technical), sustainable organisational commitments, climate impact of computation, exploitative labour, and AI training/consumption of collections. (pp.3–4, Principles 4–11)

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

- Gives a **field-specific articulation** of “collections as data” that complements FAIR and archival standards, but foregrounds ethics, power and inequality in computational use.  
- Directly relevant to positioning DDR as a **computationally usable historical collection** whose modelling, exposure and access policies have ethical and political stakes.  
- Offers language and principles for handling AI use of DDR data, documenting silences, and recognising labour and climate implications of the DDR infrastructure.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- Justifies structuring DDR as *collections-as-data* and not merely as a digital catalogue: “any digital material can potentially be made available as data that are amenable to computational use.” (p.1) 
- Strengthens the argument that DDR work must address inequities and silences in collections, and document them explicitly as part of the data model and metadata. (p.2)
- Provides principled backing for considering AI training, environmental impact and labour conditions in choices about infrastructure, formats and access modes. (pp.3–4)

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →**  
  - WS2 (data model): encoding silences, biases, provenance and community constraints.  
  - WS3 (infrastructure): access controls, AI safeguards, interoperability, climate-aware choices.  
  - WS4 (policy/guidance): DDR “collections-as-data” policy aligned with Vancouver and CARE.

- **Deliverables →**  
  - A DDR collections-as-data position statement citing Vancouver & CARE.  
  - Design notes on AI access, logging, and allowed uses of DDR data.  
  - Documentation of known gaps, silences and biases in DDR as part of the metadata.

- **Stakeholders →**  
  - Archivists and data stewards managing DDR.  
  - Communities represented in DDR (students, staff, collaborators), especially marginalised groups.  
  - Technical teams building query interfaces / APIs and AI-based services over DDR.

### Use across the methods spine

- [x] Analysis and models (how computational methods are constrained/justified)
- [x] Synthesis and interpretation

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Explicitly ethical, political framing** – centres inequity, Indigenous data sovereignty, vulnerability, climate and labour in a way that FAIR does not. (pp.2–4)  
- **Actionable principles** – 11 concise points around access, documentation, participatory design, interoperability, organisational commitment and AI.  
- **GLAM-aware** – grounded in galleries, libraries, archives and museums rather than STEM mega-repositories.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- High-level and **non-prescriptive**; leaves many implementation choices (e.g. thresholds for “responsible” AI use) to local interpretation.  
- Limited concrete examples or case studies—assumes readers will map principles to their own contexts.  
- Focused on *digital* collections; analogue and hybrid workflows get less explicit attention.

### Author’s credibility
- Padilla and co-authors are central to the **Collections as Data** movement and GLAM digital strategy; the statement builds on the widely-cited Santa Barbara Statement and is published via Zenodo with clear community provenance. (p.1)

### Contextual validity
- Intended to be **globally and interprofessionally applicable**, but explicitly acknowledges that resources and risks differ by local, regional, national and international context. (p.1)  
- Particularly suited to DDR-like institutional collections where computational use is emerging, and where inequities and silences in archives are a central concern.

### Comparisons
- Compared with **FAIR**, Vancouver is less about technical indicators and more about **ethics, community and power**, especially around AI, Indigenous sovereignty, climate and labour.  
- Extends/updates the **Santa Barbara Statement** with more explicit attention to AI, climate, labour and global Indigenous data movements.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- Encourages reading DDR not just as a *dataset* but as a **site of contested memory**, where computational access can exacerbate or help address inequities.  
- Strong push towards **participatory and community-based design** suggests DDR should build mechanisms for community input, review and contestation, not only technical APIs.  
- The AI principles support a cautious approach to using DDR materials in training data and LLM-based tools, with explicit safeguards and documentation.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “Any digital material can potentially be made available as data that are amenable to computational use.” (p.1)
- **Paraphrase:** The statement insists that collections-as-data work must explicitly confront historical and contemporary inequities in acquisition, description, access and use, documenting known silences and biases and, where necessary, imposing barriers to use to protect vulnerable communities. (Principle 2, p.2)

## Questions for further research
- How to operationalise Vancouver principles (esp. inequity, AI, climate, labour) in a **concrete DDR data model and governance policy**?  
- How to document DDR silences and biases in ways that are both **machine-actionable and legible to communities**?  
- What governance structures are needed to manage AI access to DDR collections-as-data responsibly over time?
