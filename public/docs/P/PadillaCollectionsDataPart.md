# Scope of this note

Entire white paper (19pp. PDF). Read primarily through:

- the **conceptual framing** of “collections-as-data” as a *boundary object* across GLAM, DH and data-science communities;
- the **Cohorts and Models** section (project questions, criteria, cohorts) (pp.4–8);
- the **Vancouver Summit**, **Observations**, **Outcomes** and **Moving Forward** sections (Vancouver Statement, position statements, AI and “sustain potential, mitigate harm”) (pp.9–16).

Used here as a normative and infrastructural frame for DDR as a collections-as-data testbed and for the governance of AI/RAG over heritage collections.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

The report crystallises and extends the “collections-as-data” movement. It pursues three core questions, explicitly framed as design problems for organisational models and ethics (p.5):

1. **What organisational models support sustainable collections-as-data development and access?**  
2. **What organisational models support sustainable collections-as-data *use* by researchers, artists, practitioners and others?**  
3. **How can organisations create collections-as-data in ways that address complex ethical issues and the needs of marginalised and under-represented communities?**  

The report’s aim is twofold:

- To synthesise lessons from two US-based cohorts (12 projects) and an international Vancouver summit into **principles, themes and practical models** for collections-as-data work at local and global scales (pp.3–5, 9–13).  
- To update the community’s shared normative framework via the **Vancouver Statement on Collections-as-Data**, with a stronger emphasis on ethics, labour, non-open data, climate impact and AI (pp.3, 12–13).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

This is a **synthesis and programme report**, not a single empirical study. It draws together:

- **Project design and subgranting:**  
  - *Collections as Data: Part to Whole* builds on the earlier **Always Already Computational** project (pp.3–4).  
  - Mellon-funded subgrants to **12 cohort teams** (two cohorts) across large and small US institutions, selected via criteria emphasising innovative cross-divisional models, sustainability, adaptability, inclusion of under-represented perspectives, ethical processes, awareness of complementary work, and use of open-source interoperable technologies (pp.5–6).  

- **Cohort structure and thematic synthesis:**  
  - Each team had to include a **senior administrator**, a **disciplinary scholar**, and a **project lead**, explicitly tying collections-as-data work to governance and research use (p.6).  
  - The project team extracted **cross-cutting themes** from cohort reports (pp.8–9):  
    - “No collections-as-data about us without us”;  
    - the need for supportive organisational structure;  
    - the centrality of documentation;  
    - the importance of a community of practice and skill sharing.  

- **International summit (Vancouver 2023):**  
  - A two-day **working summit** (“Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions”) at Internet Archive Canada with attendees from about **60 organisations**, selected via invitations and a call for participation (p.9).  
  - The organisers used an instructional-design approach: structured small-group and individual activities on maturity phases, model transferability, cultural context, speculative futures and statement revision (pp.9–10).  

- **Position statements and reflective synthesis:**  
  - Participants submitted **1–2 page position statements** in advance; these had already been downloaded around 800 times at the time of writing and were used to identify shared challenges and to inform the Vancouver Statement (pp.13–14).  
  - The team synthesised thematic responses across socio-cultural, technical, practical, organisational, resourcing and collaboration dimensions, and identified key challenges around AI, sovereignty, climate, linguistic diversity and barriers to engagement (pp.10–13).  

- **Conceptual framing:**  
  - The report explicitly frames **collections-as-data as a “boundary object”** (after Star & Griesemer), enabling coordination across roles, organisations and countries. It is described as weakly structured in common use, strongly structured locally (p.3).  
  - It integrates CARE principles, reparative archives and critical AI scholarship (Hughes-Watkins, Noble, Gebru and others) as normative anchors (pp.3–4, 14–16).  

No quantitative evaluation is offered; instead the report uses case aggregation, workshop reflection and community feedback as its evidential base.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Collections-as-data is best understood as a boundary object, not a fixed technical programme.**  
   - Collections-as-data is described as having “many origin stories” and evolving across institutions and countries; this diffuseness is presented as a strength because it supports “convergent effort” across roles, organisations and nations (p.3).  
   - Drawing on Star and Griesemer, the report casts collections-as-data as **“both plastic enough to adapt to local needs … yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites”**; weakly structured in common use, strongly structured locally, and operating as a **means of translation across social worlds** (p.3).  
   - This framing legitimises local variation in DDR’s schema and workflows while still tying them to a recognisable international discourse.

2. **Ethics, reparative work and non-open collections are central, not peripheral.**  
   - The report insists that **“not all collections have or should have an inevitable expression as data”**; some must *not* be open because openness would harm communities or be culturally inappropriate (p.3).  
   - It explicitly notes the history of **knowledge extraction** by libraries, archives and museums from minoritised communities, and recommends the **CARE Principles** as a starting point for engagement (pp.3–4).  
   - It cites Lae’l Hughes-Watkins on *reparative archives* and describes collections-as-data work as an opportunity “to repair the past and strengthen the future” rather than a neutral technical upgrade (p.4).

3. **Cohort projects highlight four recurring themes for sustainable collections-as-data practice.**  

   From the 12 projects, the authors distil four key themes (pp.8–9):

   - **“No collections-as-data about us without us.”**  
     Communities represented in collections must be engaged (advisory boards, team composition, calls for input). Past failures to seek input have damaged trust and limited research possibilities (p.8).  

   - **Organisational structures must support the work.**  
     Successful collections-as-data initiatives involve IT, technical services, digital collections staff, subject specialists and senior administrative support. They become woven into organisational strategy rather than isolated projects (p.8).  

   - **Good documentation is crucial.**  
     Decisions and rationales must be carefully documented to enable future stewards to maintain intent, and to allow users to assess scope and completeness (p.8).  

   - **Community of practice and skill sharing are essential.**  
     Given shifting technologies and researcher needs, practitioners call for shared documentation repositories and mechanisms for ongoing communities of practice—especially after the isolating effects of COVID-19 (p.9).  

4. **Model “transferability” is limited; principles and practices may be more useful than templates.**  
   - At the Vancouver summit, participants considered whether cohort projects offered transferable “models”. Most were seen as **proof-of-concept** rather than readily reusable templates; projects that embedded work into existing workflows and job descriptions resonated more strongly (p.10).  
   - The report suggests that **sharing practices and principles** may be more effective than imposing model replication when advancing collections-as-data work (p.10).

5. **Internationalisation reveals socio-cultural, technical and resourcing challenges and opportunities.**  
   - Participants’ reflections cluster into socio-cultural, technical, practical, organisational/resourcing and collaboration themes (pp.10–12):  
     - **Socio-cultural:** political tensions, licensing differences, gatekeeping in higher education, cultural biases, threats to autonomy and sovereignty; opportunities for FAIR/CARE adoption, reduced ethnocentrism, repatriation and expanded ways of knowing.  
     - **Technical:** heterogeneous digitisation practices; opportunities for shared infrastructure, improved OCR, linked projects and “datasheets” for collections-as-data.  
     - **Practical:** vocabulary differences, English dominance, uneven data fluency; opportunities for multilingual resources and shared practices.  
     - **Organisational and resourcing:** capacity constraints, financial limitations, pressures to defer to richer institutions; opportunities for shared infrastructure, solidarity among marginalised groups and regional hubs.  
     - **Collaboration:** institutional risk aversion versus the potential for modelling sustainable international collaborations.  

6. **The Vancouver Statement updates the community’s principles to emphasise ethics, labour, non-open data, climate and AI.**  
   - The new statement is presented as an update to the 2017 Santa Barbara Statement, foregrounding **ethics, sustainable labour, community relations, non-open data, climate impact, AI and organisational structure** (p.12).  
   - Position statements reveal shared challenges: moving collections-as-data from project to *business as usual*; building robust community connections (“Nothing about us, without us”); dealing with impacts of AI and large language models; ethics, sovereignty and contextualisation; climate impact of computational work; linguistic diversity; and lowering technical barriers (p.13).

7. **“Sustain potential, mitigate harm” becomes the clarion call for collections-as-data in an AI era.**  
   - The concluding section describes the field’s focus as sustaining the “abundantly diverse potential” of computational work (research, education, creativity) while **mitigating harm**, including bias amplification and misaligned “service quid pro quos” (p.14).  
   - It stresses transnational issues—data sovereignty, community autonomy, extraction, commodification, colonial gaze, linguistic hegemony and epistemic justice—and argues that nationalist frames constrain creativity and commitments to user communities (pp.14–15).  
   - AI is treated ambivalently: it can aid OCR, metadata generation and research services, but raises questions about unauthorised use of collections-as-data for training and about whether some datasets should be produced at all (p.15).  
   - The authors call for **“sustainable human infrastructure”**—adaptive systems that support humans doing collections-as-data work, through sharable documentation, multilingual processes and cross-institutional expertise-sharing (pp.15–16).

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

- Provides the **normative backbone** for treating DDR as a collection-as-data: ethical, infrastructural and organisational considerations, not just technical ones.  
- Articulates a **boundary-object understanding** of collections-as-data, which aligns with DDR’s position between design-historical, archival, infrastructural and AI communities (p.3).  
- Offers explicit language for dealing with **non-open and sensitive collections**, highly relevant where DDR materials involve living persons, confidential projects or communities outside the RCA (pp.3–4, 14–15).  
- Frames AI as both opportunity and risk, directly supporting the thesis’s discussion of **RAG, trustworthy AI and collections-as-training-data** (pp.14–16).

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Ethical frame for DDR-as-data:**  
  The insistence that some collections should *not* become open data, and that extraction histories must be confronted, underpins a cautious, CARE-aware approach to DDR digitisation and RAG use (pp.3–4, 14–15).  

- **Design cues for organisational models:**  
  The requirement that each project team include senior administrators, scholars and a project lead mirrors the need for **cross-role governance** around DDR infrastructure, not merely a technical team (p.6).  

- **Documentation as infrastructure:**  
  The emphasis on documentation as crucial for both stewards and users maps directly onto the DDR schema’s need for **rich collection-level and process metadata**, including rationales for inclusion, exclusion and transformation (p.8).  

- **Community engagement and “nothing about us without us”:**  
  The “no collections-as-data about us without us” theme resonates with Harris, Carter and Data Feminism, reinforcing that DDR’s redevelopment should include stakeholders represented in the records (staff, students, partners) via advisory mechanisms or co-design (p.8).  

- **AI, climate and sustainable human infrastructure:**  
  The closing call to “sustain potential, mitigate harm” and the discussion of AI, climate impact and sustainable human infrastructure provide a **policy frame** for DDR’s long-term maintenance and RAG experimentation (pp.14–16).

## Critical evaluation

### Strengths

- **Clear articulation of community-wide principles and challenges.**  
  The report synthesises cohort and summit work into succinct themes (boundary object, “no collections-as-data about us without us”, documentation, community of practice) and enumerates challenges (AI, climate, sovereignty, linguistic diversity) with unusual explicitness (pp.3, 8–9, 13–15).  

- **Bridging ethics, infrastructure and AI.**  
  It integrates CARE, reparative archives, data sovereignty, AI opportunities and harms into a single narrative, making it particularly suitable as a governance frame for computational heritage projects (pp.3–4, 14–16).  

- **Attention to labour and sustainability.**  
  The concept of “sustainable human infrastructure” foregrounds people and documentation rather than only technology (pp.15–16).  

- **International, transnational orientation.**  
  The Vancouver summit and reflections explicitly consider global inequities, nationalism and transnational collaboration, which aligns with DDR’s potential networked position in global design-research infrastructures (pp.10–12, 14–16).  

### Weaknesses and limitations

- **Lack of detailed case analysis.**  
  The report lists cohort projects but offers little granular evaluation of specific methods, outcomes or failures. “Models” remain high-level.  

- **US- and Anglophone-centrism.**  
  Despite international aspirations, the funding and cohort structure are US-centred, and English is the assumed language of tools and discourse. The international section acknowledges this but cannot fully escape it (pp.10–12).  

- **Limited technical specificity.**  
  While the report advocates open-source and interoperable technologies, it does not specify architectures, standards or graph/linked-data patterns; these must be supplied by other sources (Bizer, Hawkins, FAIR, Gooding).  

- **Non-systematic evidence.**  
  Summaries of challenges and themes rely on workshop exercises and position statements rather than systematic empirical research; the document is best read as reflective and programmatic.

### Author’s credibility

Padilla, Scates Kettler and Shorish are prominent figures in collections-as-data, digital scholarship and library leadership. The project is Mellon-funded and builds on a widely cited earlier initiative (*Always Already Computational*), and the report is positioned as a definitional statement for the field’s current phase.

### Contextual validity

- Highly applicable to GLAM and heritage contexts engaging with digitisation, computational use and AI.  
- Specific funding and infrastructure environments (US Mellon ecosystem, OSF-based outputs) differ from the UK, but the **principles and challenges** travel well.

### Comparisons

- With **Gooding (critically addressable data)**: Gooding focuses more on technical addressability and scholarly use; Padilla et al. focus on **organisational and ethical frameworks**.  
- With **Santa Barbara and Vancouver Statements**: this report documents the field’s maturation and expands the normative horizon (climate, AI, labour).  
- With **Data Feminism and Harris/Carter**: Padilla et al. bring a collections-as-data angle to similar themes of power, missingness and harm, framing them in institutional and infrastructural terms rather than only theoretical ones.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights

- For DDR, this report justifies treating **“DDR as collections-as-data”** not as a mere technical convenience but as a **boundary-object project**: one that must be negotiated among archivists, historians, data scientists, AI developers and communities represented in the records.  
- The emphasis on **non-open and sensitive collections** pushes against an uncritical “open everything” impulse. This supports keeping some DDR materials behind controlled interfaces or omitting them from AI pipelines, while still documenting their existence and constraints (pp.3–4, 14–15).  
- “No collections-as-data about us without us” suggests that DDR’s reconstruction and modelling ought to include **participatory elements** such as advisory boards of past students and staff, and community review of vocabularies and schemas (p.8).  
- The AI discussion and “sustain potential, mitigate harm” tagline provide a **succinct justification** for a deliberately slow, critical approach to DDR’s RAG system, emphasising documentation, provenance and governance over rapid deployment (pp.14–16).

### Alternative explanations?

One might argue that many challenges identified (funding, language, climate) are generic to GLAM digitisation, not specific to collections-as-data. The report implicitly counters this by showing how the **computational turn**—datafication, AI and global collaboration—intensifies and reconfigures these challenges, particularly around extraction, sovereignty and scale (pp.10–16).

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?

- **Practice:**  
  - DDR should adopt a “datasheets for collections-as-data” style of documentation, capturing scope, provenance, ethical constraints and known harms for each collection or dataset.  
  - Documentation of organisational decisions (appraisal choices, digitisation priorities, RAG inclusion/exclusion) should be retained alongside item-level metadata.  

- **Policy:**  
  - Collections-as-data governance should be embedded into institutional policies on digitisation, AI use, environmental impact and community engagement, rather than treated as an isolated technical project.  

- **Theory:**  
  - The boundary-object framing can be used to theorise DDR as a site where different epistemic communities negotiate what counts as “design research”, what counts as a record, and how computational infrastructures redraw those boundaries.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase

- “In many respects, collections-as-data is a kind of ‘boundary object’ … Weakly structured and strongly structured, abstract and concrete, locally situated and broadly framed, collections-as-data is a boundary object that works to encourage diverse forms of collaboration within and across communities that support responsible development and computational use of memory organization collections.” (p.3)  
- “Not all collections have or should have an inevitable expression as data. Some collections should not be made openly accessible because open access would pose harms to communities represented in the collections… Other collections-as-data development efforts must critically contend with a history of knowledge extraction exacted by libraries, archives, and museums on minoritized communities.” (pp.3–4)  
- *Paraphrase:* The Part to Whole project posed three main questions: which organisational models support sustainable collections-as-data development and access; which support sustainable collections-as-data use; and how organisations can create collections-as-data in ways that address complex ethical issues and the needs of marginalised communities (p.5).  
- “No collections-as-data about us without us… Communities represented in collection-as-data must be engaged… Prioritizing community involvement will not only show respect and help to build trust but it will also result in more generative research and education possibilities.” (p.8)  
- “Good documentation is crucial… It is imperative that decisions and rationales are well-documented… Good documentation is crucial for collections-as-data users as well, insofar as documentation speaks to questions of motivation, scope, and completeness…” (p.8)  
- *Paraphrase:* The Vancouver Statement on Collections-as-Data updates the Santa Barbara Statement by emphasising ethics, sustainable labour, community relations, non-open data, climate impact, artificial intelligence and organisational structure (p.12).  
- “Collections-as-data practitioners are motivated… to sustain the abundantly diverse potential of computational work… while mitigating the potential for harm.” (p.14)  
- “Ideally, all collections-as-data effort is backed by ‘sustainable human infrastructure’… [which] encourages and supports development of sharable documentation, multilingual project processes and outcomes, opportunities to share technical expertise across institutions…” (pp.15–16)  
- “Sustain potential, mitigate harm. Let that be the clarion call.” (p.16)

## Questions for further research

- How can a **“datasheets for collections-as-data”** approach be concretely implemented for DDR, including ethical constraints, known harms and environmental considerations?  
- What organisational model at RCA best mirrors the **cross-role structure** recommended here (senior administrator + scholar + project lead + technical/data stewardship) for DDR?  
- How should DDR’s collections-as-data strategy respond to the risk of its data being used as **training material for external AI systems** without consent?  
- What mechanisms would embody “no collections-as-data about us without us” in DDR practice—advisory boards, participatory cataloguing, co-authored documentation?  
- How can DDR contribute to and benefit from an international **collections-as-data community of practice**, given UK funding and structural constraints?
