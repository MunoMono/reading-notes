# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** Bowker & Star give the canonical claim that classifications are infrastructure with consequences, which lets me treat DDR cataloguing/metadata/access as “testamentary traces” of epistemic shift (not neutral description). ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** S2 core: shift is observable where categories and standards become taken-for-granted infrastructure that shapes what counts as evidence, what is visible, and who is served. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** “Classification” here is not a label; it is a working system (standards + routines + artefacts) that organizes labour and memory. This is the mechanism I need for DDR, not a metaphor. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will cite Bowker & Star only when I can (1) point to a DDR classification/metadata decision or standard, and (2) show a concrete consequence (inclusion/exclusion, distortion, access friction, loss of nuance) as evidence of shift. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Bowker & Star write at the intersection of STS, information infrastructure, and classification studies. Their intervention is to show that categories and standards are not neutral: they encode values, coordinate work, and shape memory, often becoming invisible as infrastructure. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** The core upgrade for my project: treat DDR metadata systems as *sites of epistemic politics*—the archive’s ordering is not after-the-fact; it is the condition of what can be known and reused. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to make classification visible as infrastructure by showing that standards and categories coordinate work and memory, and that their consequences—especially exclusions and distortions—must be treated as central evidence, not administrative residue. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  

## Lit review wiring (for copy/paste)
- **Lit review role:** Canonical S2 anchor: classification/standards as infrastructure with consequences; invisibility + “othering” as mechanisms; local work vs global standards.
- **1 sentence to paste into lit review:** Bowker and Star argue that classification systems are not neutral labels but infrastructural arrangements that coordinate work and memory; because they become taken-for-granted, their exclusions, “other” categories, and embedded values have real consequences for what becomes visible and usable as evidence. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Classification systems are infrastructure: they organise work and memory, and they have consequences.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** TODO (needs page) — capture the book’s framing that classification is infrastructural and consequential. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If classification is infrastructure, then metadata schemas, controlled vocabularies, and catalogue structures are epistemic machinery, not neutral wrappers.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** I treat DDR description and classification as “testaments” of epistemic shift because they encode what the institution makes legible and retrievable as knowledge.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR: identify one schema/controlled vocabulary rule and one downstream consequence for retrieval/interpretation)

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** Standards and categories become powerful because they become invisible and taken-for-granted; “good fit” for some produces friction or invisibility for others.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** TODO (needs page) — capture the argument about invisible infrastructure and differential fit/membership. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** When infrastructure is invisible, value judgments appear as “just the way things are,” making shift harder to detect unless you examine seams and breakdowns.
- **So what for my thesis:** DDR activation should surface seams (breakdowns, workarounds, category disputes) because that is where shift becomes observable.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR: an example of a workaround, exception, or “other” bin that reveals mismatch between materials and categories)

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** Residual categories (“other”) and boundary practices reveal what a system cannot represent; exclusions and distortions are not bugs but structural outcomes.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** TODO (needs page) — locate where they discuss residual categories/exclusions and the politics of what gets classified vs erased. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If exclusions are structural, then absence/silence in DDR is evidence of classification limits and institutional priorities, not simply missing data.
- **So what for my thesis:** I can treat DDR silences and “misc” groupings as evidence of epistemic shift: shifts in what the institution can or will represent.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR: pick one “misc/unknown/other” area and trace what got pushed there and why)

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Classification (as infrastructure):** categories + standards + routines that coordinate work and shape memory; not merely labels. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **Standards:** codified agreements that travel across contexts but require local work to function (and impose consequences). ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **Residual / “other” category:** a structural bin that reveals representational limits and produces invisibility. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **Seams / breakdowns:** moments where infrastructure becomes visible through mismatch, repair, or dispute. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A direct rationale for treating DDR metadata and description as *primary evidence* of epistemic shift. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
  - A method cue: look for seams (workarounds, breakdowns, “other” bins) as shift detectors. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
  - A warning: neutrality claims hide value and power; accountability requires making classification choices inspectable. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will write DDR activation as a *design problem of legibility*: surface classification consequences without collapsing usability for users. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What minimal set of DDR “classification disclosures” (schema choices, vocabularies, exceptions) would make shift legible to users while keeping the archive navigable? ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** S2 lit review: justify classification/standards as infrastructural power, and why “other” bins and seams are evidential for shift. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star, *Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences* (1999). Then Bowker and Star (1999).
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO (DDR: one catalogue field + one controlled vocabulary + one exception/workaround documented)
- **Workstreams →** S2 (primary); bridges to S3 (computational surfacing of shift via metadata/terms) and S1 (genealogy of method categories)
- **Deliverables →** DDR “seams map” (where classification breaks); “other-bin audit” tool; classification disclosure checklist
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archivists/metadata stewards; archive users; RCA governance/ethics

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** This book gives the conceptual mechanism (classification as infrastructure) but does not automatically supply DDR-specific page-cited case material; I must tie it to DDR records and show consequences in situ. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I cite “classification has consequences” without demonstrating a specific DDR category/standard and a concrete consequence, I turn infrastructure critique into slogan and lose evidential force. ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``

# Chicago NB payload (capture what you’ll need later)
- **Key pages to reuse:** TODO (add after page audit: 3–5 anchor pages for infrastructure, invisibility, “other,” seams/workarounds) ``[@Bowker1999SortingThingsOut, p. TODO]``  
- **First full note (write it out here):** Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star, *Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences* (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1999), TODO.
- **Short note form:** Bowker and Star, *Sorting Things Out*, TODO.
- **One quote worth lifting (≤2 lines):** TODO (needs page) — choose one sentence that defines classification-as-infrastructure or consequences (keep ≤2 lines).
- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** Bowker and Star show that classification systems and standards become invisible infrastructure that coordinates work and memory; because they encode values and create residual “other” bins, they produce exclusions and distortions that must be treated as central evidence, not administrative detail. (TODO pages)

# Related works (only if it directly connects)
- TODO (add only the most direct bridge: archival description standards / metadata ethics / infrastructural studies)

# Follow-ups (next actions, not vibes)
- What I will read next: A DDR/archival standards text (ISAD(G) / description ethics) to operationalise this in institutional record-keeping.
- What I will test or write next: Run an “other-bin + seams audit” on one DDR collection: list (a) residual categories, (b) exceptions/workarounds, (c) fields that collapse nuance; treat each as a shift indicator with an archive ID. TODO
