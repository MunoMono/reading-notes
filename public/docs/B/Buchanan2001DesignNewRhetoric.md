# Scope of this note
This note covers the entire argument of Buchanan’s article (pp.183–206), with particular focus on:  
- Buchanan’s claim that **design is a “new rhetoric”**—an architectonic productive art operating across disciplines;  
- his reconstruction of McKeon’s intellectual programme;  
- the argument that design provides a contemporary vehicle for addressing pluralism, invention and cultural change.

The text is engaged here as a **foundational articulation of design as epistemic method** and therefore central to Strand 1.1 (canonical design-methods texts).

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Buchanan asks how **design** can be understood within the **tradition of rhetoric as an architectonic productive art** capable of managing pluralism, invention and cultural complexity. His central aim is to show that design has emerged as a **new universal rhetoric**—a practical art that coordinates disciplines, integrates theory and practice and shapes the human-made world (p.186).

He positions this work as an extension of Richard McKeon’s project to reinterpret rhetoric as a method for addressing the “problems of our time” by making philosophy operative in cultural practices (pp.185–186).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

This is a **philosophical and historiographic essay**, drawing on:

- **Close reading** of McKeon’s philosophy of culture and new rhetoric (pp.184–187);  
- **Historical reconstruction** of design as a discipline emerging from craft, industrial production and professionalisation (pp.187–190);  
- **Analytical synthesis** that links rhetorical theory to contemporary design fields, proposing a conceptual model of design’s “four orders” (pp.191–195).

There is no empirical dataset; the method is argumentative and interpretive, grounded in textual evidence and cultural theory.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Design functions as a “new rhetoric”**  
   - Buchanan argues that design now performs the rhetorical function McKeon foresaw: a **universal, architectonic productive art** uniting ideas and action (pp.186–188).  
   - Design mediates between theory and practice, bridging words and things—*res et verba*—and making invention operative in culture (p.186).

2. **The history of design mirrors rhetoric’s transformation**  
   - Design originated as craft, professionalised in industrial society and only later became an object of theory (pp.188–189).  
   - Its disciplinary expansion (graphic, industrial, engineering, interaction, environmental design) reflects a shift from specialist skills to broad cultural method (pp.189–190).

3. **Design’s core contribution is managing pluralism and complexity**  
   - Buchanan outlines four **“orders” of design**—symbols, things, actions, environments—as different loci for addressing “wicked problems” (pp.192–194).  
   - Design allows coordinated reasoning across diverse human concerns and is therefore philosophically significant for the 21st century (pp.194–195).

4. **Design should be understood as an emerging liberal art**  
   - He concludes that design education ought to cultivate “liberal” capacities—not merely technical skill—so that people may participate with purpose in constructing the human-made world (pp.195–196).  
   - This is framed as a modern Ciceronian project: rhetoric reappearing through design (p.196).

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

- Buchanan provides a **canonical justification** for treating design as a method of inquiry rather than a decorative or technical practice—precisely the argument needed in Strand 1.1.  
- His “four orders” help articulate how **documentation, infrastructure, interaction and institutional design** relate, which later informs DDR as a complex organisational archive.  
- His focus on pluralism, invention and wicked problems links directly to computational archival work and the epistemic drift of design research.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Design as architectonic method:**  
  Buchanan argues that design is a “universal art” coordinating ideas, actions and products (p.186). This supports framing DDR’s schema and computational model as design-led rather than purely technical.

- **History of design as emerging discipline:**  
  The account of design’s professionalisation through industrial production and proliferation of subfields (pp.188–190) parallels DDR’s own institutional evolution.

- **Four orders of design:**  
  The notion that designers work across symbols, things, actions and environments (pp.192–194) provides conceptual scaffolding for categorising DDR’s heterogeneous materials (documents, processes, interactions, systems).

- **Design as liberal art:**  
  The call for “design as an emerging liberal art” (pp.195–196) strengthens arguments for DDR as an educational, epistemic and cultural project rather than an administrative unit.

## Critical evaluation

### Strengths
- **Elegant synthesis of rhetoric and design.** Buchanan brings classical theory into dialogue with modern practice, with strong textual grounding (pp.184–187).  
- **Clear articulation of design as method.** His four orders remain influential and applicable across domains (pp.192–194).  
- **Historically sensitive.** His discussion of design’s emergence from craft and industrial production shows disciplinary lineage (pp.188–190).  
- **Normative ambition.** Treating design as a liberal art foregrounds cultural responsibility, aligning with contemporary debates on ethics and impact.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Underdeveloped critique.** Buchanan’s optimism about design’s universality sidesteps tensions such as power, exclusion or institutional politics.  
- **Limited empirical grounding.** Claims about design’s societal functions are asserted more than demonstrated.  
- **McKeon as dominant lens.** Reliance on a single philosophical lineage risks narrowing conceptions of rhetoric.

### Author’s credibility
Buchanan is a central figure in design theory and one of the key proponents of the “designerly ways of knowing” tradition, with extensive influence in design research.

### Contextual validity
The argument generalises primarily to Western design education and theory. It travels well conceptually but may overstate design’s universality.

### Comparisons
- **Cross (2006)** emphasises epistemic drift but with more methodological specificity.  
- **Simon (1969)** similarly positions design as human intentionality but with a systems orientation.  
- **Findeli** provides more critical social grounding than Buchanan’s philosophical view.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- Buchanan’s argument that design is a contemporary form of rhetoric reframes **design research as a method for managing cultural pluralism**—highly relevant for DDR’s interdisciplinary character.  
- The four orders of design can guide **schema design**, clarifying where documents, practices and institutional structures sit.  
- His emphasis on invention legitimises **experimental computational tools** (e.g. RAG systems) as extensions of design’s rhetorical work.  
- Reading Buchanan alongside critical archival theory foregrounds what he omits: power, silence and institutional constraint.

### Alternative explanations?
One might argue that design’s universality is less rhetorical and more infrastructural—an effect of industrial capitalism and globalisation rather than a philosophical renaissance.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?
- For DDR’s computational models, Buchanan supports **plural, multi-level classification**.  
- For institutional narratives, his historical framing helps situate DDR in broader design pedagogy.  
- For epistemic positioning, his argument anchors design research as both inventive and interpretive.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “The new architectonic productive art should become a universal art, an art of producing things and arts, and not merely one of producing words and arguments” (p.186).  
- “Design offers a pathway for bringing theory… into closer relationship with practical action and the creation of diverse kinds of products and experiences” (p.186).  
- *Paraphrase:* Design emerged from craft and professional practice before becoming a subject of theoretical concern, mirroring rhetoric’s historical development (pp.188–189).  
- “The discipline… has proliferated as the application of design thinking expands in innovative directions” (p.189).  
- Buchanan’s “four orders” of design—symbols, things, actions and environments—characterise different loci of human problems designers address (pp.192–194).  
- “Design may be an emerging liberal art… so that all men and women may participate with clearer purpose in the creation of the human-made world” (pp.195–196).

## Questions for further research
- How can Buchanan’s “four orders” inform concrete classification and schema design for DDR?  
- How might critical archival perspectives complicate Buchanan’s universalist claims?  
- In what ways does treating design as a liberal art reshape institutional narratives of DDR?  
- Can Buchanan’s rhetoric-oriented framing support the epistemology of computational archives and explainable AI in DDR?
