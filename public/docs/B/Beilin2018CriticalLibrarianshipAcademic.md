# Scope of this note
This note covers the whole chapter. It treats the piece as a meta–critical reflection on **critical librarianship’s entanglement with academia, theory, privilege and activism**, read alongside Drabinski for Strand 3.2 (“Classification as ethics/politics”).

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Beilin asks **what happens when critical librarianship becomes closely aligned with academia**, and how academic discourse, theory and professional structures shape who can participate in critical librarianship.

The chapter aims to:
- Examine why critical librarianship appears dominated by academic librarians, despite broad definitions like Samek’s that encompass *“an international movement of library and information workers that considers the human condition and human rights above other professional concerns”* (p. 195).
- Analyse the tension between **theory and practice** in librarianship and its racialised/elitist dimensions (pp. 200–201).
- Propose ways to make critical librarianship **more self-critical and solidaristic**, especially across lines of class, race, status and institutional position (pp. 203–204, 207–208).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

The chapter is an **interpretive, argumentative essay**, not an empirical study.

- It starts from Samek’s definition and observed debates in #critlib and LIS scholarship (pp. 195–197).
- It synthesises **secondary sources and commentary**: Hudson on “the whiteness of practicality”, Schroeder & Hollister’s survey of critical theory in LIS, Ettarh’s reflections on AMC, Eisenhower & Smith on liminality, and work on whiteness and diversity in librarianship (pp. 196–201, 203–206).
- It uses **illustrative vignettes** (e.g. #critlib chats, AMC, union struggles, early-career anxieties) to ground abstract questions of theory, privilege and access (pp. 201–202, 206–208).

The method is thus a **critical synthesis** of discourse around critical librarianship, theory and academia, aimed at reorienting practice rather than producing new empirical findings.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Critical librarianship is heavily inflected by academia and its privileges.**  
   Beilin notes that many influential definitions and practices of critical librarianship circulate in **academic contexts** and social media spaces populated by academic librarians (pp. 195–197). Proximity to scholars and teaching about race, gender, class and sexuality, plus academic credentials beyond the MLIS, contribute to a perception that critical librarianship is an “academic” pursuit (pp. 196–199). This creates a risk that the movement becomes elitist and exclusionary, despite Samek’s broader vision (p. 196).

2. **There is a deep, racialised “practicality bias” that marginalises theory.**  
   Drawing on Hudson, Beilin argues that librarianship exhibits a strong **bias toward practicality**—case studies, best practices, how-to guides—and suspicion of theory (p. 200). “Plain language” is often valued as inherently democratic, yet this can mask power: such language can “naturalize and preserve existing power relations” and rest on colonial assumptions that people outside academia are uninterested in or incapable of theoretical thinking (pp. 200–201). The discourse of practicality is shown to be bound up with whiteness and professional norms.

3. **Critical librarianship needs theory, but must remain self-critical about who wields it.**  
   Beilin maintains that **critical theory is necessary** for critical librarianship, providing tools from feminist, critical race, queer and Marxist traditions to locate libraries within broader structures of domination (pp. 199, 203). At the same time, theoretical fluency is often tied to academic pedigree, class and race privilege (pp. 198–199). The chapter therefore calls for a **self-critical critical librarianship** that recognises privilege and avoids using theory as a status marker (pp. 203–204, 207).

4. **Academic librarians occupy a liminal position that can support solidarity.**  
   Building on Eisenhower and Smith, Beilin suggests that academic librarians often inhabit a **“stuck” or marginal position** between faculty and staff, academy and “outside world” (pp. 204–205). This liminality can be a resource: it may make librarians less invested in academic status and more able to build solidarities with students, precarious workers and marginalised communities (p. 205). However, librarians also sometimes reinforce hierarchies by distancing themselves from paraprofessionals and non-academic librarians (p. 205).

5. **Labour struggles and organising are key sites where theory and practice meet.**  
   In the context of the neoliberal academy, with eroded job security and increasing precarity, Beilin highlights labour struggles (e.g. the LIU lockout) as places where critical librarianship can move from discourse to action (pp. 205–206]. Marxist and political economy approaches are presented as particularly relevant (p. 206). The slogan “if it’s not accessible, it’s not radical” is discussed critically as a reminder of exclusionary language, but Beilin notes that any theory can be made accessible through thoughtful mediation (e.g. *Marx for Beginners*) without abandoning its complexity (pp. 206–207).

6. **Tensions within critical librarianship should be made productive rather than suppressed.**  
   The chapter closes by arguing that fissures in the left and in #critlib—around theory, privilege, race and status—reflect the very structures critical librarianship seeks to oppose (p. 207). These tensions should be harnessed to build **solidarities on the terms of the oppressed**, not the privileged, while still affirming academic theory as a resource for struggle (pp. 207–208). Critical librarianship should thus embrace theory *and* activism, keeping Samek’s human-rights-centred definition as its horizon (p. 208).

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

For Strand 3.2, this chapter complements Drabinski by:

- Situating **critical librarianship itself as a historically and institutionally situated practice**, shaped by academic structures, whiteness and class.
- Making explicit that critical work on classification, archives and infrastructures is always done from **particular positions of privilege, precarity and liminality**.
- Providing a vocabulary for discussing the project’s own position: a PhD located in an art and design institution, drawing on theoretical traditions, yet oriented toward infrastructural design and practice.

It helps the project frame DDR and its computational re-infrastructuring as **critical, but not innocent**: theory-laden, institutionally embedded, and obliged to be self-reflexive about who is empowered to speak and redesign.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Clarifies the academic bias of critical discourses.**  
  The observation that critical librarianship has become strongly associated with academic librarians and #critlib (pp. 196–197) can be used to position the thesis as a consciously academic intervention that must still remain accountable to non-academic stakeholders around DDR.

- **Links theory/practice tensions to whiteness and privilege.**  
  Beilin’s use of Hudson’s “whiteness of practicality” (pp. 200–201) helps the project argue that both “practical” tools (schemas, databases, RAG systems) and theoretical frameworks carry racialised, classed assumptions. This is vital when claiming that DDR computational work is “practical” or “usable”.

- **Supports a reflexive, solidarity-oriented methods stance.**  
  The call to use theory without status-marking and to build solidarities across divides (pp. 203–204, 207–208) can underpin a methodological section on reflexivity: who the researcher is, which communities DDR design choices serve, and how to avoid reproducing internal hierarchies (e.g. between “data professionals” and admin staff).

- **Connects critical librarianship to labour and institutional politics.**  
  The emphasis on precarity, union struggles and neoliberal restructuring (pp. 199, 205–206) can be woven into discussion of DDR’s administrative history and the constraints under which its documentation was produced and is now maintained.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Meta-critique of the movement.**  
  The chapter does not simply celebrate critical librarianship; it interrogates its academic bias, elitism and blind spots (pp. 196–199, 203–204).

- **Integration of multiple strands (whiteness, class, precarity, theory).**  
  It brings together work on whiteness, labour, theory–practice tensions, and social media discourse into a coherent analysis (pp. 198–201, 205–207).

- **Balanced stance on theory vs accessibility.**  
  Beilin resists both anti-theory populism and jargon for its own sake, arguing that theory can be made accessible without being diluted (pp. 206–207).

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Lack of empirical depth.**  
  The analysis relies on secondary sources and anecdotal observation of #critlib rather than systematic empirical data; there is no formal content analysis or interview study (pp. 196–201).

- **Primarily North American, academic focus.**  
  The chapter centres the North American academy and the LIS discourse around Library Juice, ACRLog, Lead Pipe, etc. Applicability to other geographies and sectors is implied but not examined (pp. 196–199).

- **Limited direct engagement with classification/infrastructures.**  
  The focus lies on theory, status and discourse rather than the technical specifics of cataloguing or metadata; those connections need to be made by the reader.

### Author’s credibility
Ian Beilin is an academic librarian and scholar of critical librarianship. His engagement with Library Juice Press, #critlib discourse and wide citation of key LIS and critical-theory authors situates him as a credible commentator within the field (pp. 195–196, 209–210).

### Contextual validity
The arguments about academia, privilege, theory and practice resonate broadly within critical librarianship and adjacent critical fields. However, the specifics of #critlib Twitter culture and North American academic structures may not fully translate to other contexts; they function best as **diagnostic analogies** rather than universal truths.

### Comparisons
- **With Drabinski (2019).**  
  Drabinski focuses on infrastructures, classification and labour inside libraries; Beilin zooms out to examine how critical librarianship itself is shaped by academic privilege and discursive norms. Together they provide both **internal** (classification, labour) and **meta** (field formation) perspectives.

- **With Schwartz & Cook and Moss & Thomas.**  
  Those works analyse archives and silences as power-laden; Beilin does similar work for **critical practice itself**, cautioning that even critical movements reproduce inequalities unless self-reflexive.

- **With Gilliland & Caswell.**  
  Both stress the importance of imagination and affect, but Beilin foregrounds the social conditions under which critical imaginaries are articulated (who has access to theory, conferences, journals).

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
For the project, Beilin’s chapter signals that **critical work on DDR’s archive and computation cannot assume an innocent outsider stance**. The thesis draws on academic theory, institutional affiliation and specialised tools; these are privileges that need to be acknowledged and leveraged responsibly.

It also suggests that:
- Design decisions about DDR’s schema, database and RAG interface should be accompanied by **attention to accessibility of language and concepts**, avoiding unnecessary jargon while not shying away from theoretical complexity.
- The work should build **solidarity with practitioners and staff** who have long maintained DDR’s records but may not speak in critical theory registers.
- The theory–practice debates in critical librarianship map onto design research debates around speculative vs operational work; Beilin supports a stance that holds both together, harnessing tensions rather than resolving them away.

### Alternative explanations?
One might argue that critical librarianship’s academic flavour is simply a function of where publishing happens. Beilin’s analysis shows, however, that academic structures—credentials, whiteness, conferences, publishing expectations—actively shape who speaks and whose concerns become central (pp. 196–199, 203–205].

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?
- **Practice:** Encourage co-authored, cross-status work around DDR (academics, practitioners, paraprofessionals), resisting the concentration of voice in the PhD author alone.
- **Policy:** Recognise that institutional support for critical work (time, funding, recognition) is uneven; computational DDR might be used to argue for more equitable resource distribution.
- **Theory:** Use Beilin to justify a deliberately reflexive theoretical position in the thesis, acknowledging the academic nature of its critique while aspiring to broader relevance.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- Samek’s definition: critical librarianship as *“an international movement of library and information workers that considers the human condition and human rights above other professional concerns”* (p. 195).
- **Paraphrase:** Beilin notes that this broad vision contrasts with the reality that much critical librarianship appears to be articulated by academic librarians and through academic discourse, which risks exclusion and elitism (pp. 196–197).
- On practicality and theory: Hudson describes practicality as a hegemonic narrative in LIS, where most output takes the form of “case studies, standards, best practices, how-to guides, recipe books” (p. 200).
- **Paraphrase:** Beilin, via Hudson, argues that calls for “plain” or “clear” language are not neutral and may naturalise existing power relations and presume that oppressed groups are uninterested in theory (pp. 200–201).
- On liminality: Eisenhower and Smith’s description of the library as a “stuck place” is used to argue that academic librarians occupy a marginal position that can support solidarity with students and marginalised groups (pp. 204–205).
- Labour and accessibility: the slogan “if it’s not accessible, it’s not radical” is discussed as a critique of jargon, but Beilin stresses that making theory accessible need not mean abandoning complexity, citing *Marx for Beginners* as an example (pp. 206–207).
- Conclusion: the chapter affirms both academic theory and activism, arguing that critical librarianship should embrace theory “while at the same time remain true to the vision…that places the human condition and human rights above professional concerns” (p. 208).

## Questions for further research
- How do theory–practice tensions and academic privilege shape critical work on **classification and computational infrastructures** beyond North American academia?
- What methods could empirically capture experiences of exclusion or elitism in critical librarianship (e.g. interviews with non-academic or paraprofessional staff)?
- How can theoretical frameworks used in the DDR project be **re-articulated in accessible forms** (teaching materials, documentation, interfaces) without losing their critical edge?
- In what ways can labour organising and institutional politics around DDR (past and present) become explicit sites of critical librarianship and design research?
