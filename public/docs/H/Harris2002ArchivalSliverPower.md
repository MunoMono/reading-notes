# Scope of this note
Whole article (pp. 63–86). Read here as a central theoretical account of **archives as power-laden slivers of social memory**, grounded in South Africa’s transition from apartheid. It anchors Strand 3.3 on absence, silence and missing data, and underpins the reading of DDR as an *archival sliver* shaped by institutional power. 

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?

Harris asks:

- **What is the relationship between archives, social memory and power in South Africa’s transition from apartheid to democracy?**
- **How do apartheid-era archival systems, record destruction and post-apartheid reforms expose the limits of archives as memory and as instruments of justice?**

He aims to reconfigure the metaphor of archives from mirror or “central memory institution” to an **“archival sliver”**—a tiny, constructed, power-saturated fragment of social memory—and to sketch a post-apartheid **“enchanted” archival praxis oriented towards justice** (pp. 64–65, 82–85).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.

- **Interpretive, essayistic case study** drawing on Harris’s experience as a South African archivist (including work with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and investigations into records destruction) (pp. 63–64).
- Uses:
  - Historical narrative of apartheid, the State Archives Service (SAS) and post-1990 transformation (pp. 66–81).
  - Examples from TRC investigations into systematic destruction of public records (e.g. National Intelligence Service destroying c.44 tons in 6–8 months) (p. 64).
  - Engagement with theorists (Derrida, Trouillot, Lyotard, Spivak, Brink, Hamilton) to build a **theory of archives as constructed, partial and power-saturated** (pp. 65, 69, 82–85).

No formal empirical sampling; evidence is archival-historical and reflexive.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions

1. **Archives are only a “sliver” of social memory and documentary production.**  
   - Harris describes the archival record as “but a sliver of social memory” and “but a sliver of the documentary record” (p. 64).  
   - Even if every record created in a country were preserved, it would still be “a sliver of a window into that country’s experience”; in reality, deliberate and inadvertent destruction shrinks this to “a sliver of a sliver” from which archivists select “a sliver of a sliver of a sliver,” often only partially described (pp. 65–66).  
   - This metaphor directly contests the notion of archives as mirror-like reflections of reality and warns that if repositories are treated as “the world’s central memory institutions, then we are in deep, amnesic trouble” (p. 65).

2. **The apartheid archival system actively produced silence through bureaucracy, secrecy and destruction.**  
   - The state’s vast bureaucracy generated a “formidable memory resource” documenting racial classification, movement, employment, surveillance and confiscation; registries and record strongrooms “converted the abnormal into the normal” (p. 69).  
   - Obsessive secrecy, interlocking legislation and selective destruction distorted formal information systems in support of propaganda (pp. 69–70).  
   - TRC investigations revealed massive, centrally authorised destruction of public records between 1990 and 1994, targeted especially at security records; all confiscated records from anti-apartheid organisations were destroyed, and records of those organisations were further thinned by raids and the need for activists to avoid committing information to paper (pp. 64, 70).  
   - SAS itself was racialised, hierarchical and complicit: serving mostly white users, “oiling the wheels of apartheid bureaucracy” through records management, spying on reading-room users, and pursuing appraisal and collecting policies that privileged elite, white, Afrikaner narratives while neglecting black, women’s and grassroots experiences (pp. 71–74).

3. **Post-apartheid “transformation discourse” reframes archivists as active shapers of memory but remains partly trapped in positivism.**  
   - Transformation discourse recognises archivists as “active documenters of society and shapers of social memory” rather than impartial custodians (p. 77).  
   - It drives reforms: the National Archives of South Africa Act (1996); macro-appraisal; a “total archives” collecting vision aimed at “giv[ing] the voiceless voice”; outreach and “tak[ing] archives to the people”; rights-based access (Promotion of Access to Information Act 2000) (pp. 76–81).  
   - However, Harris argues that transformation discourse still clings to a **positivist paradigm** that assumes stable concepts (“archives,” “record”) and treats records as reflections of reality. It defines archives mainly as physical holdings and focuses on shaping the record rather than participating in broader processes of memory formation and storytelling (p. 83).  
   - Archivists are still inclined to close down meaning (through neat outreach products, metanarratives and treating oral history as “source” rather than “history”), rather than embracing multiplicity, fluidity and uncertainty (pp. 83–84).

4. **Archives are expressions and instruments of power; neutrality is itself a political choice.**  
   - Harris reiterates that archives “at once express and are instruments of prevailing relations of power” (p. 63).  
   - Drawing on Derrida and Foucault, he positions the archive as a **“crucible of human experience, a battleground for meaning and significance, a babel of stories, a place and a space of complex and ever-shifting power-plays”** (p. 85).  
   - Any attempt to be impartial, to “stand above the power-plays,” is a choice “to replicate if not to reinforce prevailing relations of power” (p. 85).  
   - He calls for archivists who recognise their complicity, treat language as an instrument of power, listen for marginalised voices and are guided by a “call of and for justice,” however impossible and contradictory that may be (pp. 85–86).

5. **Towards an “enchanted sliver”: opening the archive rather than closing it.**  
   - In the conclusion he argues that the archival record is “a fragile thing, an enchanted thing, defined not by its connections to ‘reality’, but by its open-ended layerings of construction and reconstruction” (p. 84).  
   - Archivists should move from “detaining” meaning to **“releasing meanings, tending mystery, opening the archive”**, and cultivating hospitality to otherness (pp. 84–86).  
   - The “enchanted sliver” metaphor stresses imagination, multiplicity and justice, rather than completeness or neutrality.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?

- Provides a **foundational vocabulary for absence and silence** (sliver, destruction, secrecy, amnesia) that can be applied directly to DDR’s incomplete record.
- Grounds the claim that DDR’s archive is not just incomplete by accident but **constructed under specific institutional power relations**; what is present and missing is politically meaningful.
- Supports a methodological stance: the DDR computational work is not neutral infrastructure but **another layer in the construction of the archival sliver**, with responsibilities towards justice and contestation.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)

- **Conceptual anchor for “archival sliver” and missingness.**  
  The formulation that researchers see only “a sliver of a sliver of a sliver” and that archives are “constructed windows” into processes underwrites the project’s caution about what DDR can and cannot show (pp. 64–65, 82).  

- **Evidence of deliberate destruction and structural erasure.**  
  Harris’s account of systematic destruction of security records and confiscated anti-apartheid materials, and of activists’ reluctance to create records, provides a **worked example of state-produced silence** (pp. 64, 70). This can be used as a comparative case when analysing DDR’s less dramatic but still structured absences (e.g. what was never documented, what may have been culled).

- **Model of archival institutions as racialised infrastructures.**  
  Description of SAS as white, Afrikaans, hierarchical and complicit gives a template for reading DDR’s own bureaucratic culture and user base: who created it, who it served, which epistemes shaped appraisal and collecting (pp. 71–74).

- **Normative orientation for design decisions.**  
  The claim that attempts at neutrality simply reinforce prevailing power, and that archivists are “subject to the call of and for justice” (pp. 85–86), legitimises a **value-explicit** stance in DDR’s schema and RAG design (e.g. making missingness visible; prioritising marginalised topics).

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths

- **Powerfully theorised from a deeply situated standpoint.**  
  Harris combines personal involvement (TRC, National Archives) with critical theory, giving the article both empirical grounding and conceptual reach (pp. 63–64, 82–85).
- **Definitive articulation of archival partiality.**  
  The “sliver of a sliver of a sliver” metaphor has become canonical; it is analytically sharp and easily portable to other cases.
- **Explicit link between archives and justice.**  
  The insistence that neutrality is a political choice and that archivists are called to justice offers a rare, explicit ethical position within archival literature (pp. 85–86).

### Weaknesses and limitations

- **South-Africa-specific political context.**  
  The argument is rooted in apartheid and transitional justice; translation to other settings requires careful analogy rather than direct mapping.
- **Less attention to digital infrastructures.**  
  Harris notes technological revolution and postmodernity but does not elaborate on digital archival systems, automation or AI; those connections must be built by the project (pp. 82–83).
- **Limited operational detail.**  
  “Enchanted” praxis is sketched normatively; there are few concrete methods for operationalising hospitality to otherness or “opening the archive.”

### Author’s credibility

- Verne Harris is a leading South African archivist associated with the South African History Archive and later the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The article builds on his previous peer-reviewed work on access, legislation and records destruction, and is published in *Archival Science*, lending both scholarly and practitioner credibility (p. 63).

### Contextual validity

- While extreme conditions (apartheid, TRC) are not universal, Harris explicitly argues that **constructedness and power are realities “informing archives in all circumstances”** (p. 63). The specific mechanisms (racial bureaucracy, secrecy laws, TRC) vary, but the general model travels well.

### Comparisons

- **With Schwartz & Cook (2002).**  
  Schwartz & Cook conceptualise archives as instruments of power and modern memory; Harris gives a **single-country, high-intensity case study** that dramatizes these dynamics and adds the sliver metaphor.
- **With Moss & Thomas, Carter, Gilliland & Caswell.**  
  Those works focus on silences and imaginaries; Harris foregrounds deliberate destruction, secrecy and bureaucratic normalisation as mechanisms producing the sliver.
- **With Data Feminism / Mehrabi et al.**  
  Harris maps the power-laden formation of the archive; Data Feminism and Mehrabi et al. analyse how such partial data produce downstream harms in data science and ML. Together they support the project’s archival–computational chain.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights

- For DDR, Harris encourages treating **every presence and absence as evidence of power**, not as random noise. The “archival sliver” becomes a way to talk about DDR’s survivals and gaps without pretending to completeness.
- His critique of positivist notions of archives as mirrors supports the project’s move away from treating DDR data as ground truth for AI. Instead, DDR is a **constructed, partial training corpus** whose gaps and slants must be surfaced.
- The call to “open the archive” and be hospitable to otherness suggests that DDR’s schema, interfaces and RAG explanations should **invite contestation and alternative narratives**, not just deliver answers.

### Alternative explanations?

One could argue that South Africa’s extreme context makes the sliver metaphor inapplicable elsewhere. Harris pushes against this by insisting that **even in “relatively calm backwaters of established democracies” ignoring power is perilous** and any claim to neutrality perpetuates dominant relations (p. 85). DDR can be read through this lens even without spectacular destruction.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory?

- **Practice:** embed documentation of DDR’s missingness, destruction and appraisal decisions into the system; treat appraisal reports and ingestion logs as part of the archive.  
- **Policy:** argue for governance structures around DDR that balance institutional control with accountability and external voice, echoing Harris’s emphasis on commissions and watchdog bodies (pp. 77–79).  
- **Theory:** position DDR as an “enchanted sliver” and design computational tools that foreground this status rather than trying to simulate a total archive.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase

- “The archival record is but a sliver of social memory. It is also but a sliver of the documentary record.” (p. 64).  
- “So archives offer researchers a sliver of a sliver of a sliver. If, as many archivists are wont to argue, the repositories of archives are the world’s central memory institutions, then we are in deep, amnesic trouble.” (p. 65).  
- **Paraphrase:** Between 1990 and 1994, huge volumes of public records—especially from security agencies—were systematically destroyed as part of a state-sanctioned sanitisation of official memory, while records confiscated from anti-apartheid organisations were also destroyed (pp. 64, 70).  
- “By their silences and their narratives of power, their constructions of experience, apartheid’s memory institutions legitimised apartheid rule.” (p. 69).  
- **Paraphrase:** SAS’s appraisal and collecting policies favoured elite, white, establishment histories; struggles against apartheid, black experiences and women’s voices were poorly documented and often seen only through white eyes (pp. 73–74).  
- “The archival record is best understood as a sliver of a sliver of a sliver of a window into process. It is a fragile thing, an enchanted thing, defined not by its connections to ‘reality’, but by its open-ended layerings of construction and reconstruction.” (p. 84).  
- “Any attempt to be impartial, to stand above the power-plays, constitutes a choice, whether conscious or not, to replicate if not to reinforce prevailing relations of power.” (p. 85).  
- **Paraphrase:** Archivists are called to justice; the archive is a battleground for meaning where one cannot keep one’s hands clean, and the task is to engage otherness continually and honestly, without blueprints or final answers (pp. 85–86).

## Questions for further research

- How might a **“sliver” analysis** be operationalised for DDR—e.g. systematically tracing which strata (programmes, departments, demographics) are slivered away at each stage (creation, appraisal, digitisation, modelling)?  
- What does an **“enchanted sliver”** mean in a computational context: how can RAG systems “open” rather than close meaning?  
- How can DDR’s appraisal history be reconstructed and itself archived as part of the record, following Harris’s suggestion that appraisal reports are key texts?  
- In what ways could DDR governance structures embody Harris’s call for justice (e.g. advisory boards, community input, transparency around destruction and access decisions)?
