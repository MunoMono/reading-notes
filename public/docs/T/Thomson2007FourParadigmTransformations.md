# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** To borrow an explicit “paradigm shift” frame (with testaments and infrastructures) for mapping epistemiv shift across methods, institutions, and digital mediation.  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Lit review / methods genealogy: I can justify treating testimony + its infrastructures (recording, cataloguing, indexing) as sites where epistemic shift becomes visible.  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** “Paradigm transformations” keeps the unit of change big enough (theory + practice + institutions + tools), not just “method trends.”  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will only use Thomson if I can (a) name concrete “testaments” (recordings, transcripts, catalogues, interfaces) and (b) show how a change in medium/practice changes what counts as evidence.

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Thomson (Sussex; oral history educator/editor) writes as an insider synthesising field history for methodological self-awareness. The “problem-space” is disciplinary legitimation + methodological sophistication, with an added push to address digital change as a major transformation rather than a technical detail.  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** The “four paradigms” is a useful organising device, but it risks smoothing uneven, contested histories into a clean sequence; treat as a scaffold, not a law.

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to explain how oral history changed by narrating four paradigm transformations in order to strengthen contemporary practice through historical and methodological self-awareness.

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Oral history has undergone four paradigm transformations that track broader historiographical/methodological shifts, not just a new “source type.”
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Thomson explicitly outlines four transformations (postwar “people’s history”; late-1970s post-positivist memory/subjectivity; late-1980s reflexive interviewer/analyst; late-1990s/2000s digital revolution). ``[@Thomson2007FourParadigmTransformations, p. 49–51]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If a field’s methods, theory, and institutional practices repeatedly reorganise around new assumptions (memory as source → memory as object; interviewer as neutral → reflexive co-producer; transcript dominance → aural/digital navigation), then “epistemic shift” is observable as a sequence of redefinitions of evidence and authority.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** I can frame DDR “activation” as designing for paradigm visibility: showing how what counts as evidence shifts with practices, roles, and infrastructures.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — identify DDR testaments that correspond to each transformation (e.g., early recordings; cataloguing regimes; editorial/transcription conventions; digitisation/UX/search).

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** The “unreliability” of memory becomes a methodological resource once memory is treated as an object of analysis, not just a source to verify.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Thomson describes the second shift: from defending reliability (guidelines, sampling, corroboration) to arguing that subjectivity and “unreliability” are strengths that reveal meanings and relations between past/present, identity, and collective memory. ``[@Thomson2007FourParadigmTransformations, p. 53–55]``
- **Warrant (my words):** This reframes the epistemic criterion: truth-as-correspondence is not abandoned, but supplemented by truth-as-meaning (how people make sense), which changes what “counts” as evidence and what analysis is for.
- **So what for my thesis:** A DDR “testament” should not be restricted to verified facts; it can be designed as evidence of how institutional memory is made, stabilised, and contested (i.e., drift becomes legible in the record itself).  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — choose one DDR object where “silences/discrepancies” are traceable across description, access, and reuse (e.g., conflicting metadata, missing provenance, narrative overlays).

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** The digital revolution is not only technical; it changes epistemology by reshaping access, indexing, and interpretive possibilities (including AI-assisted discovery).
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Thomson argues digital tools transform recording/preservation/cataloguing/sharing; anticipates sophisticated indexing and cataloguing “perhaps assisted…by artificial intelligence”; cites Frisch’s “post-documentary sensibility” and warns about institutional/ethical frictions. ``[@Thomson2007FourParadigmTransformations, p. 68–70]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If retrieval and navigation change (audio/video searchable, non-text indexing, database paths generated by queries/occasions), then the archive’s epistemic surface changes: what can be found, compared, and made persuasive changes.
- **So what for my thesis:** “Activation” can be specified as building interfaces and provenance-aware retrieval that make drift visible (what changes, who changes it, and what gets lost) rather than pretending digital access is neutral.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — map DDR digitisation/indexing workflow and identify where AI/ML could (a) expose drift or (b) amplify distortions.

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Paradigm transformation:** a field-level reorganisation of theory + practice + method assumptions (use as *heuristic timeline*, not a universal law). ``[@Thomson2007FourParadigmTransformations, p. 49–51]``
- **Post-positivist memory/subjectivity:** treating memory’s subjectivity as analytically productive, not merely error. ``[@Thomson2007FourParadigmTransformations, p. 53–55]``
- **Post-documentary sensibility (Frisch via Thomson):** collapsing source/product boundary; enabling generative paths through indexed audio/video records. ``[@Thomson2007FourParadigmTransformations, p. 68–69]``

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A clean *sequence-of-shifts* device for writing a methods genealogy without getting stuck in micro-debates.  
  - A legit bridge from “methods history” to “archival infrastructure,” because digital transformation is treated as epistemic change, not convenience.  
  - A vocabulary for “testament” as both narrative evidence and infrastructural trace (recording → transcription → catalogue → interface).
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will treat “four paradigms” as a *mapping grid* to locate DDR artefacts, not as a claim that all contexts follow the same path.  
  - I will operationalise “digital revolution” as *changes in evidence handling* (indexing, provenance, access paths), not “digitisation” as such.
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What is the DDR-equivalent of Thomson’s “paradigm testaments”—which objects, standards, and interfaces show the shift most clearly?  
  - Where does “activation” sit: in collection policy, description standards, discovery UX, or interpretive practice?

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Lit review section introducing “epistemic shift” as field-level changes in evidence, authority, and infrastructure (methods genealogy).  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** *Alistair Thomson’s “Four Paradigm Transformations in Oral History” (2007)*.  
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO — DDR archive workflow note: recording → description standard → catalogue fields → search/browse UI → reuse context.  
- **Workstreams →** S1 methods genealogy; S2 record-keeping distortions; S3 computational legibility layer  
- **Deliverables →** timeline + “testament” typology; DDR activation prototype requirements (indexing, provenance, interpretability)  
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archivists; RCA research community; public users; platform/IT maintainers

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** This paper is a field history of oral history; it won’t on its own specify DDR cataloguing standards or give a concrete design method for archive activation.  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I import the “four paradigms” too literally, I may force DDR materials into a neat narrative and miss local discontinuities and institutional politics.
