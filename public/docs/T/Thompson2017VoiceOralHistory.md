# Scope of this note
Focuses on Chapters 2–4 (“The Value of Oral History,” “Evidence and Interpretation,” and “History and the Community”). These chapters provide the epistemological and ethical foundation for integrating oral testimony into archival and computational design-research practice. 

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Thompson’s central question is how memory can serve as legitimate historical evidence. He challenges positivist historiography by demonstrating that personal narrative offers insight into meaning, emotion and social structure—not despite its subjectivity, but through it. His aim is to show that oral history transforms both the content and the social meaning of history by recovering voices excluded from official archives.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
Thompson draws on two decades of interviews conducted through the Oral History Society and the National Life Stories project at the British Library. His method is reflexive: he examines transcription, interpretation, and context as co-productive acts. Rather than statistical validity, credibility arises from triangulation—cross-referencing testimony with documentary, photographic, and institutional sources.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Oral history democratizes archives.** It reclaims memory as evidence and situates knowledge in everyday experience, giving voice to groups absent from institutional record.  
2. **Memory is interpretive, not defective.** The distortions and inconsistencies of recollection reveal cultural logic and social meaning.  
3. **Shared authority.** Interviewers and narrators co-create knowledge through dialogue; interpretation is collaborative.  
4. **History as moral act.** Oral history involves responsibility—whose stories are preserved, and how they are mediated.  
5. **Archives as living systems.** Memory continuously reanimates record, ensuring that archives evolve through reuse and retelling.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
Thompson’s framework directly strengthens the project’s qualitative strand. It validates interviews with former DDR members as epistemic acts that extend archival data into lived history. His notion of the “living archive” parallels the project’s computational model, where interaction and reinterpretation reconfigure the record. Memory thus becomes a form of relational metadata—context that cannot be captured by documents alone.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Positions oral testimony as **data enrichment**: a qualitative layer that exposes affect, motivation, and contradiction within DDR’s institutional record (pp. 125–132).  
- Supports the methodological claim that **subjectivity is a mode of evidence**, not noise—key to legitimising oral narratives alongside computational patterning (p. 144).  
- Frames **interviewing as collaborative design**, aligning with participatory reclassification and the ethics of data provenance (pp. 161–164).  
- Reinforces the project’s argument that archives become **living infrastructures** through engagement and reinterpretation (p. 170).

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Qualitative triangulation; ethics and participation.  
- **Deliverables →** Integration of oral-history transcripts as indexed entities within the DDR database.  
- **Stakeholders →** Surviving DDR researchers, archivists, oral historians, and design-research educators.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Canonical and widely cited; offers the most comprehensive justification for oral history as legitimate research method.  
- Methodologically reflexive: integrates ethics, narrative theory, and social critique.  
- Conceptually bridges qualitative and archival epistemologies.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- Primarily sociological in scope; limited engagement with computational or digital infrastructures.  
- Emphasis on community history may understate institutional contexts such as design research departments.  
- Somewhat dated in technological terms—requires reinterpretation for digital archives.

### Author’s credibility
Paul Thompson (b. 1935) founded the UK Oral History Society and the National Life Stories collection at the British Library. His career at the University of Essex established oral history as an academic discipline, making him a foundational figure in the field.

### Contextual validity
Thompson’s arguments generalise across historical and design contexts. His principles of reflexivity, participation and ethics translate directly to computational archival infrastructures that evolve through user interaction.

### Comparisons
Aligns with Portelli (1991) in treating memory as meaning, not fact; complements Ritchie (2011) on the evolution of oral history practice. Diverges from purely documentary historiography by prioritising interpretation over verification.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Thompson reframes evidence as a relational act—produced through memory, dialogue, and moral responsibility. In this light, DDR oral histories are not supplementary but constitutive data: they reveal how design knowledge was negotiated, embodied, and remembered. Integrating testimony into computational structures extends this principle—treating database updates as iterative acts of recollection.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory
- Establishes oral history as **qualitative infrastructure**—a participatory layer within digital archives.  
- Positions interview-based metadata as a form of epistemic transparency: showing how institutional memory changes through engagement.  
- Provides ethical rationale for open-access and participatory data governance frameworks.

### How does it shape your thinking?
It situates the project’s oral-history component not as anecdotal but as epistemological: a necessary counterpart to computational inference. Thompson provides the ethical grammar for integrating living memory with digital method—ensuring that the DDR’s record remains human, situated and self-aware.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “The past is not only what happened but what people remember and how they remember it.” (p. 125)  
- “Oral history transforms both the content and the social meaning of history.” (p. 127)  
- **Paraphrase:** Thompson argues that the act of remembering is itself a historical process—each telling reshapes the archive and redistributes authority between researcher and participant. (pp. 130–134)
