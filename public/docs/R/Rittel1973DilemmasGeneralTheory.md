# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** To get a canonical statement of why “social/planning” problems resist stable definitions/solutions, so I can treat archival traces as contested testaments rather than neutral facts. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–162]``  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** S1 methods genealogy: this is the pivot from method-as-solver to method-as-argument under value conflict and uncertainty (why shift is expected, not accidental). ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–166]``  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** “Wicked” names a specific structure (indeterminate formulation + value conflict + irreversible consequences), not just “complex”. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–165]``  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will cite Rittel/Webber only when I can show (1) a concrete disagreement over problem framing/criteria and (2) an archival trace of the consequences (a record, classification, or decision trail). ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 161–163]``  

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Rittel and Webber write in the early 1970s amid expanding public-sector planning and policy complexity, arguing that “social problems” differ from “tame” scientific/engineering problems because they are inherently value-laden and contested. They frame planning as a form of argument and judgement under uncertainty, not a domain of definitive solutions. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 155–157]``  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Their point implies that institutional archives will not simply store solutions; they will store competing framings, criteria, and aftermaths—i.e., places where epistemic shift becomes materially legible. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–166]``  

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to show that planning deals with “wicked problems” that cannot be definitively formulated or solved like tame problems, so planners must treat problem-solving as iterative judgement and argument under value conflict and irreversible consequences. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–163]``  

## Lit review wiring (for copy/paste)
- **Lit review role:** Canonical justification for treating planning/design-method claims as problem-framing + criteria-setting (a site where shift appears), not as neutral technical optimisation.
- **1 sentence to paste into lit review:** Rittel and Webber (1973) argue that planning deals with “wicked problems” with no definitive formulation, no stopping rule, and no true/false solutions, so method functions as judgement and argument under value conflict rather than as technical problem-solving. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–163]``  

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Many planning/social problems are “wicked”: you cannot define them cleanly and then solve them.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** The authors state that planning problems are “wicked” and contrast them with “tame” problems; they emphasise that for wicked problems, understanding the problem and solving it cannot be separated in the usual way. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, p. 161]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If formulation and solution co-evolve, then the “problem” is not a stable object; method is part of how the object is made.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** I use Rittel/Webber to justify treating DDR archival traces as testaments of framing (what was treated as the problem), not just evidence of outputs.
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR case where the “problem” changes across records: brief → catalogue description → later reinterpretation)

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** Wicked problems do not have a stopping rule and do not have true/false solutions; they have better/worse outcomes judged by values.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** They list properties: no stopping rule; solutions are not true-or-false but good-or-bad; evaluation depends on value judgements. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 162–163]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If “done” is not formally determined and success is value-laden, then institutional criteria are central—and likely to shift over time.
- **So what for my thesis:** This gives me language to treat changing archival standards/criteria as epistemic shift (a shift in what counts as “good” description, good evidence, good method).
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR example: a classification/description standard change that revalues what counts as relevant evidence)

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** Every attempted solution to a wicked problem is a one-shot operation with irreversible consequences, so you cannot safely “trial-and-error” your way to truth.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** They state that every solution is a “one-shot operation” because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, and that each attempt has consequences that matter. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, p. 163]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If actions are consequential and irreversible, then records of decisions and their aftermath are part of the epistemic field—not afterthoughts.
- **So what for my thesis:** This supports my “testament” approach: DDR activation should foreground decision trails, revisions, and consequences as evidence of shift.
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR record trail showing revisions/constraints and downstream effects: acquisition → cataloguing → access/use)

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Wicked problem:** A problem class characterised by indeterminate formulation, no stopping rule, value-laden evaluation, and solution attempts that have consequential effects. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–163]``  
- **Tame problem:** A problem that can be clearly formulated and solved with known techniques (used here as a contrast class). ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–162]``  

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - shift is structurally expected where problems are value-laden and where “good” solutions depend on contested criteria. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 162–163]``  
  - Archives can be activated as evidence of shifting framings and criteria, not only as stores of artefacts. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 161–163]``  
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will treat catalogue description/classification as a problem-framing practice that materially shapes what can be known (and therefore where shift becomes visible). ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 161–165]``  
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What are the DDR archive’s operational “good/bad” criteria (selection, description, access), and how have they changed across time? ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 162–163]``  

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Literature review / methods framing: justify why shift should be read as shifts in framing + criteria under wicked conditions (esp. no stopping rule; good/bad not true/false). ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 162–163]``  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention: Rittel and Webber, “Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning” (1973). Then Rittel/Webber (1973).
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO (DDR description record(s) that show reframing/criteria change; include archive IDs)
- **Workstreams →** S1 methods genealogy; S2 archive description as framing; S3 (optional) computational surfacing of framing shift
- **Deliverables →** A “wickedness-to-archive” paragraph: why archives store contested framings; a shift rubric keyed to criteria changes
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archive users; institutional stewards; examiners needing a non-vibe rationale for shift

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** This text explains why problem-framing is contested; it does not itself tell me how to operationalise “testamentary traces” in DDR without my archival + computational methods. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 160–163]``  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I use “wicked” as a generic synonym for “hard,” I lose the specific structure (no stopping rule; good/bad evaluation; irreversible consequences) that makes shift a testable claim. ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 162–163]``

- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** Wicked problems cannot be separated into stable formulation + solution; solutions are judged good/bad rather than true/false, and each attempt has consequential, often irreversible effects. (pp. 161–163) ``[@Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory, pp. 161–163]``

# Follow-ups (next actions, not vibes)
- What I will read next: TODO (pick a DDR/archival standards text to connect wickedness → institutional record-keeping)
- What I will test or write next: Choose one DDR record chain and write a 150–200 word “wicked framing” mini-case: show the framing/criteria shift with 2–3 concrete record changes (IDs + dates). TODO
