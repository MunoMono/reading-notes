# Scope of this note
This note focuses on the introductory chapter of *The Routledge International Handbook of Practice-Based Research* (Candy, Edmonds & Vear, 2022), which defines the theoretical and methodological architecture of practice-based research (PBR). The analysis interprets this framework through the triadic position of **researcher–practitioner–designer**, examining how practice becomes both the method and the site of inquiry. It links this conceptualisation to broader debates in epistemic legitimacy, interdisciplinarity, and the role of artefacts in generating knowledge.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
The chapter seeks to answer the question: *What constitutes practice-based research, and what distinguishes it from other forms of scholarly inquiry?*  
Candy, Edmonds and Vear propose that PBR is a “principled approach to research by means of practice” (p. 27), foregrounding the **centrality of practice**, **the role of artefacts**, and **the forms of knowledge** that arise from them. Their goal is to formalise a field that legitimises practice as a mode of producing new and communicable knowledge, rather than as mere creative or technical output.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
The chapter functions as a conceptual synthesis rather than an empirical study. It draws on historical precedents—from clinical medicine and education to design and digital arts—to illustrate how PBR evolved across disciplines where traditional research methods failed to capture the epistemic complexity of practice. The authors employ comparative and genealogical analysis, tracing developments from the 1970s onwards, and highlight institutional and regulatory shifts that enabled artefacts to be recognised as legitimate research outputs (p. 33).  

The method is therefore *meta-theoretical*: it consolidates diverse practitioner narratives into a coherent epistemology that can operate across disciplinary boundaries.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Practice as central** — PBR redefines research as an interdependent relationship between *doing* and *knowing*, where practice and reflection operate in tandem (p. 28).  
2. **Artefacts as epistemic media** — Objects, performances and systems are not by-products but integral sites of knowledge production (p. 29).  
3. **Knowledge as communicable** — New insights must be original, validated, contextualised, shareable and retainable (p. 30).  
4. **Practitioner-researcher centrality** — The individual conducting the work is positioned as both generator and interpreter of knowledge (p. 28).  
5. **Cross-disciplinary expansion** — The chapter maps how PBR has developed in medicine, education, nursing, software engineering, art and design, demonstrating how professional and creative practices converge through reflective enquiry (pp. 31–33).  
6. **Institutional evolution** — From the 1970s, regulatory changes (e.g., CNAA validation, AHRC recognition) allowed artefact-based PhDs to enter mainstream academic legitimacy (p. 33).  
7. **Community-building and cultural change** — The authors highlight the emergence of collective models (studios, laboratories, collegia) as infrastructures for sustaining inter-disciplinary PBR (pp. 34–37).  

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
The handbook provides the most comprehensive articulation of practice-based research as an epistemic system. Its argument that “practice and research are complementary but distinctive” (p. 28) reinforces the intellectual legitimacy of practitioner-led inquiry while maintaining academic rigour. For a project concerned with reconstructing epistemic transitions in design research, this framework clarifies how practice functions as both *methodological engine* and *epistemological territory*—bridging experiential and systematic knowledge.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
The text offers concrete criteria for distinguishing between *practice as craft* and *practice as research*:
- **Evidence:** “Research and practice operate as interdependent and complementary processes leading to new and original forms of knowledge” (p. 27).  
- **Evidence:** “Knowledge that remains private to the individual… is unlikely to have an impact on the wider world” (p. 29).  
- **Evidence:** The requirement that knowledge be *communicable and retainable* (p. 30) aligns directly with principles of open, reproducible and archived research infrastructures.

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Methodological framing for analysing practitioner-led archival practices.  
- **Deliverables →** Justification for artefact-based outputs and multimodal dissemination.  
- **Stakeholders →** Academic researchers, design practitioners, digital humanities curators.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Establishes PBR as a principled, not permissive, approach—emphasising rigour and communicability.  
- Provides cross-sectoral legitimacy by grounding creative practice alongside professional research in healthcare and engineering.  
- Introduces a durable epistemic vocabulary: *centrality of practice*, *role of artefacts*, *forms of knowledge*.  
- Offers a typology of research environments (studio, laboratory, living lab) that integrate reflection, making, and dissemination.  
- Recognises the practitioner as epistemic agent rather than subject of study.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- The framework presumes institutional compliance and infrastructure that are not universally available.  
- Overemphasis on artefacts risks marginalising less material practices (e.g., relational design, policy, service).  
- The researcher–practitioner identity is idealised: insufficient attention is given to precarity, labour conditions, or institutional hierarchies.  
- While claiming interdisciplinarity, examples remain predominantly Anglo-European and technology-centric.  

### Author’s credibility
Linda Candy and Ernest Edmonds are leading figures in computational creativity and art–science research, while Craig Vear’s expertise in digital performance provides practical grounding. Together, their experience in supervising and conducting practice-based PhDs gives the text both methodological authority and institutional insight.

### Contextual validity
The framework is most applicable within research-intensive contexts where creative practice is formally recognised as research. In less formalised environments, its criteria for validation—originality, shareability, and retention—may be aspirational rather than achievable.

### Comparisons
- **With Archer (1979):** Both assert the inclusion of design alongside science and humanities, but PBR extends this into post-disciplinary praxis.  
- **With Cross (1982):** Moves from cognitive knowing to embodied and artefactual knowing.  
- **With Schön (1983):** Systematises reflection-in-action within institutional research frameworks.  
- **With Buchanan (1992):** Parallels his integrative approach to design knowledge but grounds it in artefact-based epistemology.  

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
The chapter’s significance lies in its redefinition of research itself. By insisting that practice is not supplementary but *constitutive* of inquiry, it dismantles hierarchies that separate making from thinking.  
- **For the researcher**, it offers a schema of validation that reconciles originality with rigour.  
- **For the practitioner**, it legitimises situated, reflective and often tacit processes as sources of new knowledge.  
- **For the designer**, it affirms that artefacts can serve as epistemic vehicles, not just communicative outputs.

This tripartite alignment reconfigures the landscape of research credibility: from observation to participation, from hypothesis to enactment, and from publication to exhibition. The model implies that practice-based artefacts are *arguments in material form*—texts written through making.

### Alternative explanations
The rise of PBR can also be read as a response to the managerialisation of academia: as universities demanded measurable outputs, practitioners redefined making as research to secure institutional validation. Hence, the handbook serves both intellectual and bureaucratic functions—it is a philosophical manifesto and a strategic charter.

### Implications
The framework provides intellectual scaffolding for projects where artefacts, data systems or prototypes are simultaneously process and product. It enables a researcher–practitioner–designer to operate reflexively, generating iterative feedback loops between design acts, analytical reasoning and communicable knowledge.

- “Practice and research operate as interdependent and complementary processes” (p. 28).  
- “Knowledge from research that is private and inaccessible… is not the concern of this handbook” (p. 29).  
- “The artefact may, in its core, represent new knowledge” (p. 29).  
- **Paraphrase:** The chapter defines the researcher as a practitioner embedded in real-world contexts whose making and reflection generate shareable insight (pp. 27–30).
