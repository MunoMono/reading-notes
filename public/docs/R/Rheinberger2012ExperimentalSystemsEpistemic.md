# Scope of this note
Examines Rheinberger’s concept of “experimental systems” as epistemic frameworks where knowledge emerges through drift, uncertainty and the interplay of material and conceptual practices. The note connects this to the DDR’s own culture of experimentation and the project’s use of computational prototypes as sites of epistemic production.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Rheinberger asks how knowledge is generated within the material conditions of experimentation rather than through abstract theory. His aim is to show that science advances not by perfect control but through systems that generate unforeseen questions—processes of drift and transformation where the object of inquiry evolves as it is explored.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
The chapter is historiographic and philosophical. Rheinberger analyses historical cases from molecular biology, referencing Fleck, Bachelard and Latour to build a theory of experimental systems. He distinguishes between **epistemic things**—objects of inquiry that embody what is not yet known—and **technical objects**—stabilised apparatus that enable experimentation. The argument is grounded in close reading of laboratory practices rather than formal empirical sampling.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Knowledge emerges through experimentation, not verification.** Scientific inquiry is driven by material practice, not pre-established theory.  
2. **Epistemic things are unstable.** They transform as they are studied, embodying uncertainty and drift.  
3. **Experimental systems generate questions.** They are “machines for making the future,” producing both new objects and new problems.  
4. **Technical and epistemic objects co-evolve.** Stabilised instruments eventually become routine techniques, enabling new epistemic things to appear.  
5. **Failure and deviation are productive.** Drift and ambiguity are not methodological flaws but generative conditions for discovery.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
Rheinberger’s argument illuminates how the DDR’s plural and unfinished projects can be reinterpreted as **experimental systems**—sites where design knowledge emerged through iteration, improvisation and failure. His work provides a philosophical anchor for reading the DDR archive as a living ecology of epistemic things, aligning with the project’s emphasis on drift and reflexive method.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Frames **DDR’s laboratory ethos** as an epistemic system where artefacts and ideas co-produced one another (pp. 45–48).  
- Supports the project’s **reflexive taxonomy**, showing that classification itself can be experimental and generative.  
- Validates **computational prototypes** as experimental systems: they do not just store data but produce new relations and insights through iterative interaction.  
- Connects directly to the DDR’s **epistemic pluralism**, revealing its disorder not as deficiency but as productive instability.

**Explains how knowledge emerges from drift, failure, and experimentation—epistemic things are objects of inquiry that transform as they’re explored. Perfect conceptual anchor for your reading of DDR as a laboratory of epistemic instability. Deploy in *Reflections and Translations* to argue that DDR’s disorder and your computational prototypes both generate insight through deviation. Drift becomes method, not error—aligning with Rheinberger’s productive uncertainty.**

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Theoretical framing for “drift as method.”  
- **Deliverables →** Informs interpretation of digital prototypes as epistemic systems.  
- **Stakeholders →** Scholars of design research, digital humanities, and archival epistemology.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Provides a robust epistemology of practice grounded in material culture.  
- Introduces the now-canonical distinction between epistemic and technical objects.  
- Offers a nuanced account of how uncertainty and drift produce innovation.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- Highly abstract; assumes familiarity with continental philosophy.  
- Focused on laboratory science—requires adaptation for design and humanities contexts.  
- The productive role of social, political or institutional constraints is under-explored.

### Author’s credibility
Hans-Jörg Rheinberger is a molecular biologist and philosopher of science, former director of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. His cross-disciplinary credibility and influence in epistemology and material culture studies are exceptional.

### Contextual validity
Although based in the life sciences, his framework generalises to all experimental cultures—including design research, digital prototyping and archival systems—making it directly transferable to the DDR project.

### Comparisons
Extends Bachelard’s notion of epistemological rupture and Fleck’s thought collectives. Aligns with Latour’s actor-network theory and Jonas’s reflexive design epistemology. Diverges from Simon’s bounded rationality by emphasising emergence over optimisation.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
Rheinberger shows that experimentation is a site of becoming, where the unknown drives method. For the DDR project, this legitimises the archival “mess” as a generative system—its incompleteness and multiplicity are epistemic conditions, not obstacles. Computational re-enactment of the archive parallels Rheinberger’s concept of epistemic things that evolve through interaction.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory
- Positions **drift and deviation as epistemic resources**, not methodological errors.  
- Suggests that **digital archives should be treated as experimental systems** rather than static repositories.  
- Supports **iterative, reflexive coding and taxonomy design** as forms of inquiry.  

### How does it shape your thinking?
It reinforces the project’s claim that design research is a living, recursive practice. Archival work, like scientific experiment, produces knowledge through material engagement and surprise. Drift, failure and computational iteration become methodological virtues.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- “Experimental systems are … systems of manipulation designed to give unknown answers to questions that the experimenters themselves are not yet able clearly to ask.” (p. 47)  
- “Epistemic things embody what one does not yet know.” (p. 48)  
- **Paraphrase:** Knowledge is generated in motion—through experiments that continually reconfigure their own questions and objects. (pp. 46–50)

## Questions for further research
- How can “epistemic things” be modelled computationally in design archives?  
- In what ways does drift in the DDR archive mirror experimental drift in laboratory science?  
- How can failure and ambiguity be encoded as data for future epistemic work?
