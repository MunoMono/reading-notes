research_question:
  # Supervisor verbatim (do not “fix” wording here)
  verbatim: "how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?"
  # Working phrasing (optional; change freely)
  working: "How might testamentary traces of epistemic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCA’s DDR archive?"
  # One-line purpose (keeps notes honest)
  purpose: "Use the DDR archive to make epistemic shift legible and actionable, not just described."

# Short rules card injected into every note (keeps it simple)
