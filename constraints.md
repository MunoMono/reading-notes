# Constraints for notes + AI assistance (anti-bloat / anti-hallucination)

These rules exist to keep the thesis on track and keep notes “writeable” (not a swamp).

## 1) Non-negotiables
- Every note must point to the **North star**:
  - **Project RQ (verbatim)**
  - **Primary strand** (S1 / S2 / S3)
  - **One seam to watch** (optional but preferred)
- If something does not serve the RQ/model, write: **“OUT OF SCOPE (why)”** and stop.

## 2) Evidence rule (no hallucination)
- Do **not** state factual claims about the paper without:
  - a page reference, or
  - a clear marker: **TODO (needs page / verification)**.
- If you are unsure, you must write **TODO** rather than inventing.

## 3) Output cap (anti-bloat)
- Max **3 claims** per paper. If there are more, pick the 3 that best serve the RQ.
- Each claim must be in the format:
  - **Claim → Evidence (page) → Warrant (my words) → So-what for thesis**
- Keep each bullet tight. Prefer short sentences.

## 4) Practice interleave (mandatory)
- For each claim include a **Practice cross-check**:
  - Where my material supports/complicates this (practice note ID / archive reference).
- If not available: **TODO (add practice cross-check)**.

## 5) No antithesis / no “thesis fog”
- Don’t write “this is not about…” lists.
- Replace with:
  - **Boundary (1 sentence)**: where it stops being useful
  - **Risk (1 sentence)**: what confusion it could cause if misused

## 6) Definitions + benchmarks (ownership)
- If the paper introduces a key term I might use, I must write:
  - **Term → how I will use it (my words) → page if defined**
- Every note must include **My benchmark**:
  - 1–2 criteria for when I will treat a claim/framework as usable for my thesis.

## 7) Style rules (keep it straightforward)
- Prefer **plain language** and **short sentences**.
- Use **first person** when it prevents ambiguity (“I use this to…”, “I define…”, “I will cite…”).
- Avoid jargon unless it is defined and necessary.
- Write at least **one reusable thesis sentence** per note (the “So what for my thesis”).

## 8) Citation discipline (Chicago NB ready)
- Capture:
  - key pages
  - one short quote (≤2 lines)
  - one paraphrase
  - “first full note” + “short note form” (even if drafting uses a different rendering)

## 9) Allowed sources in a note
You may only use:
- The paper you’re reading (with page refs), and
- North star constants (project/north-star.yml), and
- Your own practice material (explicitly referenced),
- Otherwise: **TODO**.

## 10) Definition of done (for a reading note)
A note is “done” when it contains:
- Thesis job filled
- Strand selected
- 3-claim ledger completed (or fewer)
- At least 1 definition updated/confirmed (or “none”)
- Practice cross-check(s) included (or TODO)
- Boundary + risk written
- Chicago payload captured
