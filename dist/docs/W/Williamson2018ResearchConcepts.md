# Scope of this note
This review focuses on **interpretivism** and **critical theory** as presented in Williamson’s *Research Concepts* (2018). It situates Williamson’s discussion against the project’s interpretivist–critical paradigm, providing methodological grounding for reflexive briefs, taxonomic critique and practice-based inquiry.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Williamson introduces research paradigms to clarify how philosophy shapes methodology. She asks:  
- How do interpretivism and critical theory differ in assumptions about reality, knowledge and research aims?  
- How can researchers locate themselves within these paradigms to ensure methodological reflexivity?  
The purpose is to show that all research carries philosophical assumptions and that explicit paradigm alignment improves credibility and coherence [@Williamson2018ResearchConcepts, pp. 4–16].

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
This is a **conceptual synthesis**, not empirical research. Williamson contrasts four paradigms—positivism, post-positivism, interpretivism and critical theory.  
- **Sources:** philosophy of science, social theory, qualitative research debates.  
- **Key artefact:** *Figure 1.2: The interpretivist research process* (p. 14), which visualises a reflexive cycle between researcher and participants.  

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions.
1. **All research is interpretive.** Research is guided by beliefs and values, not by neutral observation [p. 4].  
2. **Interpretivism.** Assumes multiple realities constructed through interaction; knowledge is co-produced; methods are qualitative, inductive and situated [p. 9].  
3. **Critical theory.** Extends interpretivism by exposing ideology and power; aims for transformation as well as understanding [pp. 15–16].  
4. **Complementarity.** Interpretivism risks micro-level relativism; critical theory risks abstraction. Integrated, they balance meaning-making with systemic critique.  
5. **Visual model.** Figure 1.2 depicts interpretivist research as cyclical and reflexive, structurally comparable to Archer’s operational model and Freire’s praxis [p. 14].

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
- Anchors the project’s **interpretivist–critical paradigm**: interpretivism legitimises co-constructed briefs; critical theory demands scrutiny of power and exclusion.  
- Supports the **statements of intent**: systematic DDR models must be re-tested not as universal recipes but as heuristic probes under socio-technical complexity [@Williamson2018ResearchConcepts, pp. 9–16; see also 389†source].  
- Connects to **taxonomic theory**: classifications are interpretive and political, not neutral descriptors [392†source].  
- Reinforces the **research-methods spine**: Figure 1.2 exemplifies reflexive looping across archival analysis, practice intervention and synthesis [393†source].  

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- ‘All research is interpretive… guided by the researcher’s set of beliefs and feelings’ [p. 4] → confirms **reflexivity as foundational**.  
- ‘Interpretivists espouse the view that researchers and participants are interrelated’ [p. 9] → validates **action research** and evolving briefs.  
- ‘A critical social theory is concerned in particular with issues of power and justice… exposing the forces that prevent individuals and groups from shaping the decisions that crucially affect their lives’ [pp. 15–16] → underwrites **critical taxonomy** and social justice strands.  
- **Figure 1.2 (p. 14)** → provides a bridging diagram across Archer’s operational model, Freire’s praxis and Bowker & Star’s classification critique.  

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Reflexive briefs → Critical taxonomy → Participatory instruments  
- **Deliverables →** Reflexive method guidelines → Interpretivist-critical diagram → Power-exposure protocols  
- **Stakeholders →** Design researchers → Co-design practitioners → Archival theorists  

### Use across the methods spine
- [x] Framing and theory  
- [x] Study design  
- [x] Data collection and instruments  
- [x] Analysis and models  
- [x] Synthesis and interpretation  
- [x] Reporting and communications  

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Clear articulation of paradigms in accessible language.  
- Explicit linkage between epistemology and ethics.  
- Figure 1.2 offers a transferable visual model.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- Brief treatment of critical theory, condensed into two pages.  
- Western paradigm bias; little engagement with Indigenous or decolonial approaches.  

### Author’s credibility
Williamson is a respected scholar in information and library science, with extensive methodological expertise and multiple editions of *Research Methods*.  

### Contextual validity
Framework generalises across design research, archival studies and information systems. The interpretivist-critical dual stance aligns with the project’s commitments [391†source].  

### Comparisons
- **Freire (2014):** Problem-posing pedagogy as interpretivism + critical praxis.  
- **Bowker & Star (1999):** Classification as political infrastructure.  
- **Archer (1968):** Operational model mirrors Figure 1.2’s cycles.  
- **Cross (2007):** Designerly knowing rests on interpretivism.  

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- Provides philosophical legitimacy for **reflexive briefs**: interpretivism supports evolving objectives.  
- Critical theory ensures taxonomies and methods are interrogated for power.  
- Figure 1.2 can serve as a **visual hinge** between archival, practice-based and computational strands.  
- Insight: interpretivism without critical theory risks relativism; critical theory without interpretivism risks abstraction.  

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- ‘All research is interpretive… guided by the researcher’s set of beliefs and feelings about the world and how it should be understood and studied’ (p. 4).  
- ‘Interpretivists espouse the view that researchers and participants are interrelated, with each influencing each other’ (p. 9).  
- ‘A critical social theory is concerned in particular with issues of power and justice… exposing the forces that prevent individuals and groups from shaping the decisions that crucially affect their lives’ (pp. 15–16).  
- **Figure 1.2 (p. 14):** interpretivist research process → reflexive cycle akin to Archer’s operational model.

- How might Freire’s praxis extend Williamson’s interpretivism toward liberation ethics?  
- How can Bowker & Star’s infrastructure critique integrate with Williamson’s framework?  
- What safeguards ensure interpretivism does not collapse into relativism without critical engagement?
