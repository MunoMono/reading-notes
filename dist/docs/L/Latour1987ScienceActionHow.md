# Scope of this note
This extended note critically reviews Latour's *Science in Action* with emphasis on three major clusters of concepts: (1) the dynamics of black boxing and reopening (Ch. 1–2), (2) laboratories and inscriptions (Ch. 3–5) and (3) centres of calculation and action at a distance (Ch. 6–7). These ideas are triangulated with the DDR archival research spine, the interpretivist–critical framework and the taxonomic critique of systematic design. The note develops a longer-form analysis (2x the baseline) to  embed Latour’s arguments within the project’s methodological architecture, demonstrating how his vocabulary of black boxes, inscriptions and centres of calculation can illuminate the archival practices, systematic models and computational simulations that structure this research. In doing so, it positions *Science in Action* not only as a historical contribution to science and technology studies, but as a live analytical resource for re-contextualising DDR systematic methods under conditions of contemporary complexity.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
- **Chapter 2 – Laboratories.** Investigates how credibility in science is secured not in texts alone but by leading dissenters back to the laboratory, where inscriptions are produced. Latour reframes laboratories as **fact-factories**, not sanctuaries of truth. This links directly to the project’s archival strand: DDR diagrams and briefs similarly claimed authority by reference to hidden machinery of inscription.  
- **Chapter 3 – Inscriptions and Machines.** Develops the notion that scientific practice depends on **inscription devices** which transform messy reality into portable, combinable traces and introduces the **black box** as the mechanism of closure. This parallels DDR’s systematic models, which stabilised contested practices into apparently universal diagrams.  
- **Chapter 4 – From texts to things.** Shows that instruments and visual displays mobilise resources beyond the bench. Science’s strength lies in multiplying and aligning inscriptions, not in privileged access to nature. This aligns with the project’s **contribution framework**: DDR systematic design should be understood as a persuasive assemblage of diagrams and reports rather than as neutral tools.  
- **Chapter 5 – Networks and allies.** Argues that rationality is an outcome of networks enrolling allies, not an intrinsic property of ideas. Science and politics are inseparable; there are only longer and shorter networks. This maps onto DDR’s institutional alliances (RCA, Design Council, funders) that sustained systematic methods.  
- **Chapter 6 – Centres of calculation.** Examines how inscriptions are accumulated and re-written in mathematical or bureaucratic form, enabling **action at a distance**. Centres of calculation transform dispersed work into centralised authority. DDR archives functioned the same way, projecting systematic design outward through accumulated project reports and classifications.  
- **Chapter 7 – The consolidation of networks.** Describes how once facts are stabilised, the controversies and alliances that produced them become invisible. This is the **closure problem**: what looks like timeless truth is actually a contingent settlement. For the project, DDR’s systematic diagrams appear stable but mask the evolving briefs and debates that shaped them; reopening these black boxes is therefore methodologically essential.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
- **Chapter 2.** Ethnographic redescription of the laboratory. Latour follows dissenters into labs, showing how instruments and set-ups secure credibility. This provides a model for the project’s **archival ethnography**: tracing how DDR artefacts worked to stabilise claims.  
- **Chapter 3.** Conceptual and empirical analysis of inscription devices and machines. Case material demonstrates how instruments generate combinable traces. Offers the project an analytical tool for reading DDR diagrams as inscription devices rather than transparent records.  
- **Chapter 4.** Reflexive inquiry into how inscriptions mobilise resources beyond the bench. No “sample size” but discursive case analysis. Informs the project’s **comparative case analysis** strand by showing how authority is distributed across sites, not isolated in one diagram or project.  
- **Chapter 5.** Network analysis of how alliances, both human and non-human, strengthen claims. Illustrative cases rather than systematic sample. Provides methodological grounding for the project’s **interpretivist–critical framework**, where design methods are situated in networks of power and alliance.  
- **Chapter 6.** Historical and conceptual account of centres of calculation. Latour uses maps, accounts and bureaucratic records as cases. This underpins the project’s **computational modelling and data fusion** strands: both DDR and modern AI act as centres of calculation that must be critically examined.  
- **Chapter 7.** Conceptual synthesis on consolidation and closure. No empirical sample but theoretical restatement. Equips the project with the methodological caution that stability is provisional: systematic methods, whether DDR diagrams or ML pipelines, must always be treated as **re-openable black boxes**.

This methodology parallels the DDR project spine: archival analysis corresponds to Latour’s close reading of inscriptions; practice-based interventions resemble 'science in the making'. Computational modelling echoes Latour’s 'centres of calculation'.  

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Black boxes**: Stabilised facts and technologies become black boxes. Taken-for-granted modules whose internal disputes are hidden. Black boxes simplify networks but conceal labour, exclusions and failures.  
2. **Inscriptions**: Science depends on inscription devices—graphs, diagrams, formulas—that translate phenomena into portable, combinable traces. Inscriptions are the currency of persuasion and the infrastructure of accumulation.  
3. **Laboratories as inscription factories**: Laboratories are not temples of discovery but factories producing inscriptions. Their power lies in standardisation and circulation of traces, not in access to a privileged reality.  
4. **Centres of calculation**: Institutions accumulate inscriptions, enabling action at a distance. Power derives from controlling flows of representations (e.g., maps, statistics, models).  
5. **Reversibility of closure**: Closure is never final. Black boxes can reopen in crises or controversies, revealing hidden assumptions. Stability is always provisional.  
6. **Actor-networks**: Scientific knowledge is not the property of isolated minds but of heterogeneous networks linking people, artefacts and institutions.  
7. **Implications for method**: Analysts should trace controversies, follow inscriptions and examine how closure is achieved, rather than accepting stabilised categories.  

These findings resonate strongly with DDR: Archer’s systematic models functioned as black boxes, DDR diagrams were inscription devices, the RCA’s DDR itself operated as a centre of calculation. DDR’s struggles with incomplete data parallel Latour’s insistence that closure is provisional.  

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
- Latour provides a vocabulary for reinterpreting DDR systematic design as black-boxed knowledge that requires reopening and critique.  
- His emphasis on inscriptions directly links to DDR diagrams, briefs and classifications as material artefacts that structured design knowledge.  
- Centres of calculation parallel the DDR archive, where systematic methods were codified and redistributed.  
- His insistence that closure is provisional aligns with the project’s **iterative, reflexive cycles**, testing DDR methods under contemporary complexity.  
- Latour’s descriptive mechanics complement the Frankfurt school's critical theory. Latour shows how closure happens; Horkheimer asks whose interests it serves. Together they underpin the interpretivist–critical framework.  

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Supports treating Archer’s models as historically contingent black boxes rather than universal laws [@Latour1987ScienceActionHow, p. 21].  
- Reinforces taxonomic critique: DDR’s stages, briefs and data divisions are inscription categories subject to closure and exclusion.  
- Validates comparative analysis: reopening DDR controversies mirrors Latour’s method of following disputes rather than final results.  
- Provides a bridge to Gooding’s notion of 'critical addressability': both demand transparency about how data and categories are produced, transformed and stabilised.  

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Archival analysis (reopening DDR black boxes), practice-based intervention (inscription analysis in live projects), computational modelling (simulate centres of calculation), reflective synthesis (interpretivist–critical integration).  
- **Deliverables →** Critical taxonomy of DDR inscriptions, Latourian framework for critically addressable models, synthesis of archival and computational methods.  
- **Stakeholders →** Researchers of design methods, archivists, critical librarians, computational designers, AI ethics communities.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- Offers a powerful and enduring metaphor (black box).  
- Provides a practical methodology: follow controversies, trace inscriptions, map centres of calculation.  
- Integrates history, sociology and philosophy in one framework.  
- Resonates across domains (science, technology, design, LIS).  
- Anticipates issues in AI explainability and data transparency.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- Conceptual looseness: terms often metaphorical, not rigorously defined.  
- Relativist charge: critics argue Latour undermines objectivity by flattening all perspectives.  
- Limited prescriptive guidance: strong on diagnosis, weaker on constructive frameworks.  
- Empirical base anecdotal rather than systematic.  

### Author’s credibility
Bruno Latour is the co-developer of ANT, professor at École des Mines and Sciences Po, globally influential in STS. His reputation secures authority, but also polarisation: celebrated in DH and design studies, criticised in analytic philosophy.  

### Contextual validity
- Framework generalises well across domains: laboratories, archives, design departments.  
- Particularly relevant for contexts (like DDR) where inscriptions and classifications dominate knowledge production.  

### Comparisons
- Aligns with Bowker & Star (1999) on classification infrastructures.  
- Extends Gooding (2022) on black-boxed data into a general epistemology.  
- Resonates with Jaillant (2022) on archival gaps and digital infrastructures.  
- Contrasts with Archer (1968): whereas Archer sought closure via systematic models, Latour insists closure is provisional and contested.  
- Complements Frankfurt: Latour describes closure mechanics; Horkheimer critiques domination embedded within closure.  

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- DDR diagrams and briefs should be read as inscription devices: material forms that stabilised and circulated design knowledge.  
- DDR as institution was a centre of calculation: it accumulated inscriptions and redistributed them as systematic methods.  
- Archer’s systematic model can be read as a black box: simplifying design while concealing tacit labour and emergent instability.  
- Latour warns against premature closure: DDR’s failure in hospital projects illustrates the dangers of black-boxing emergent complexity.  
- For the project: AI/ML modelling must resist becoming black boxes; instead they should be critically addressable, with transparent documentation of transformations and exclusions.  

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase

### Chapter 2 – Laboratories
- 'The very rare and obstinate dissenter who has not been convinced by the scientific text … is led from the text into the place where the text is said to come from. I will call this place the laboratory.' (Ch. 2, p. 64).  
  *Why:* When DDR models fail to persuade, the project mirrors Latour’s move back to the ‘laboratory’—in this case, the DDR archive—to reopen how inscriptions were made.  

- **Paraphrase:** Latour insists that to understand science we must follow practitioners into laboratories, not just read their papers; labs are where texts gain credibility by tying inscriptions to material practices (Ch. 2, pp. 63–64).  
  *Why:* Mirrors the research spine’s practice-based intervention strand: credibility emerges in situated, iterative practice, not in abstract models.  

### Chapter 3 – Inscriptions and machines
- 'What is behind a scientific text? Inscriptions. How are these inscriptions obtained? By setting up instruments. This other world just beneath the text is invisible as long as there is no controversy.' (Ch. 3, p. 69).  
  *Why:* DDR’s systematic diagrams were inscription devices, not transparent records. Like Latour’s instruments, they constructed specific versions of design knowledge, supporting the project’s critical taxonomy and insistence on reopening archival black boxes.  

- 'When many elements are made to act as one, this is what I will now call a black box.' (Ch. 3, pp. 131–132).  
  *Why:* Archer’s operational model—and modern ML pipelines—function the same way. The project uses this black-box concept to justify reopening DDR models and computational tools.  

- **Paraphrase:** Instruments and set-ups translate material events into traces that can circulate and convince; credibility flows from the devices that generate inscriptions, not from abstract appeals (Ch. 3, pp. 67–70).  
  *Why:* Directly underpins the project’s audit of DDR artefacts, echoing Bowker & Star’s framing of classification as moral-political infrastructure.  

### Chapter 4 – From texts to things
- 'The instrument, whatever its nature, is what leads you from the paper to what supports the paper, from the many resources mobilised in the text to the many more resources mobilised to create the visual displays of the texts.' (Ch. 4, p. 70).  
  *Why:* Shows that credibility rests on inscription devices, not abstract theory. DDR’s flowcharts and briefs mobilised resources in the same way, shaping what counted as knowledge.  

- **Paraphrase:** Latour stresses that work at the bench is only part of science; many others elsewhere make science possible (Ch. 4, ~p. 162).  
  *Why:* DDR methods depended on distributed networks beyond the design team (e.g., funders, councils). This supports the project’s comparative case analysis of archival vs. live projects.  

- **Paraphrase:** The authority of science does not rest on privileged access to reality but on the ability to multiply and align inscriptions in persuasive ways (Ch. 4, pp. 87–90).  
  *Why:* Supports the project’s contribution framework: DDR methods must be re-contextualised as persuasive artefacts, not neutral truths.  

### Chapter 6 – Centres of calculation
- 'Once every trace has been not only written on paper, but rewritten in geometrical form and re-written in equation-form, then it is no wonder that those who control geometry and mathematics will be able to intervene almost anywhere.' (Ch. 6, p. 245).  
  *Why:* DDR’s systematic diagrams were not neutral but rewritings of practice into abstracted forms. Like Latour’s geometry, they created universality and enabled action at a distance.  

- 'Administration, bureaucracy and management in general are the only big resources available to expand really far… What appeared at the beginning of this book as vast and insulated pockets of science are probably best understood if they are seen to be scattered through centres of calculation, dispersed over files and records.' (Ch. 6, p. 255).  
  *Why:* DDR archives functioned as bureaucratic centres of calculation, dispersing reports and diagrams as the infrastructure of systematic design. This strengthens the framing of DDR as both archive and inscription machinery.  

- **Paraphrase:** Centres of calculation accumulate inscriptions from afar, enabling decisions and power to radiate outward without direct presence (Ch. 6, pp. 254–256).  
  *Why:* Helps position AI/RAG platforms in the project as contemporary centres of calculation, echoing DDR archival accumulation but scaled up to 2025.  

### Chapter 7 – The consolidation of networks
- **Paraphrase:** Latour notes that once facts are stabilised, it becomes difficult to see the controversies and alliances that produced them; they appear as if they had always been true (Part B, ~pp. 303–305).  
  *Why:* Captures the methodological imperative of the project: DDR archives, briefs and classifications must be treated as reopenable, not fixed.

- How can Latour’s concept of inscriptions be operationalised in computational modelling of DDR diagrams?  
- What does it mean to keep AI/ML tools critically addressable, avoiding black-boxing?  
- Can centres of calculation be mapped using RAG architectures that accumulate multimodal DDR data?  
- How to combine Latour’s descriptive mechanics with Frankfurt’s normative critique in analysing DDR archives?  
- What does 'reopening black boxes' look like in practice-based design interventions?  
- How might reflexive taxonomies (Gilliland, Bowker & Star) extend Latour’s approach to DDR classifications?  

## Takeaways from Science in Action in 2025
Latour argues that every ML/RAG pipeline is an inscription factory, every content platform a centre of calculation and every model a black box whose authority must be continually reopened to scrutiny; otherwise, we repeat Archer’s error of mistaking provisional systematicity for universal law.
1.	**Black boxes are now AI models.** Latour’s metaphor lands squarely on contemporary machine learning. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and large language models present outputs as if they were fluent, authoritative knowledge, yet their inner workings remain largely inaccessible. Inputs (queries, prompts) and outputs (synthetic text) are visible, but the transformations — embeddings, parameter updates, retrieval logic — are largely hidden. Latour’s insistence that black boxes must be studied before closure is a call to critically audit and document ML systems before they become unquestioned defaults.
2.	**Inscriptions are content pipelines.** In 1987, inscriptions were lab notebooks and graphs; in 2025, they are vector embeddings, metadata tags, prompt templates and retrieval logs. These are the traces that allow AI systems to accumulate knowledge and circulate it across contexts. Just as DDR diagrams stabilised design methods as portable knowledge, today’s content engineering pipelines stabilise information in formats legible to algorithms. Latour helps us see these not as neutral infrastructure but as sites of categorisation, exclusion and hidden labour.
3. **Centres of calculation are data infrastructures.** Latour’s “centres of calculation” find their analogue in cloud platforms, data lakes and model hubs. Action at a distance is now algorithmic: a model trained in one centre shapes practices across the globe. DDR’s RCA archive was a small centre of calculation; in 2025, OpenAI’s API endpoints or enterprise content-engineering platforms play that role at planetary scale. The logic is the same: whoever controls the accumulation and formatting of inscriptions controls how action propagates.
4. **Closure is provisional but harder to reopen.** Latour stressed that black boxes can always be reopened in controversy. Yet in ML, economic and technical forces (proprietary weights, commercial NDAs, opaque pipelines) make reopening extremely difficult. Critical addressability — Gooding’s term — is a more demanding standard in 2025, requiring transparency in data provenance, code and model behaviour. Without it, models risk becoming Latourian black boxes that stabilise flawed or biased classifications at massive scale.

### Why this matters now
- For design research (DDR lens): Latour’s warning against premature closure resonates with the project’s emphasis on iterative, reflexive cycles. Just as Archer’s systematic models failed when treated as final recipes, ML models fail when treated as complete substitutes for judgement.
- For taxonomies: Bowker & Star’s warning that classifications are political ￼ converges with Latour: embedding categories into embeddings and metadata is a political act, not a neutral one.
 - For interpretivist–critical frameworks: Latour provides the descriptive mechanics (how closure happens), while Frankfurt-style critique and Gooding’s 'critical addressability' provide the normative demand (why transparency is ethically required)
