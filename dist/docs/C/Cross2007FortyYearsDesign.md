## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
This editorial essay, written for the 40th anniversary of the Design Research Society (DRS), reflects on the trajectory of design research from the early 1960s to the mid-2000s. Cross asks:  
- How did design methods emerge as a field of inquiry?  
- What were the phases of enthusiasm, rejection and renewal?  
- How did design research consolidate into a coherent discipline with its own epistemology and methods?  
The purpose is to map the historical arc of the design methods movement and to articulate the legitimacy of 'designerly ways of knowing' as equal to scientific and scholarly traditions [@Cross2007FortyYearsDesign, pp. 1–3].

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
This is a **historical–reflective editorial**, not empirical research. Cross draws on:  
- Archival accounts of conferences (e.g., 1962 London, 1965 Birmingham, 1967 Portsmouth).  
- Publications of the 1960s–80s (Asimow, Alexander, Archer, Jones, Rittel, Schön).  
- Personal scholarly involvement in the development of design methods.  
It is qualitative, interpretivist and synthetic in nature, aiming to narrate and periodise forty years of developments in design research rather than generate new empirical data.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Origins (1960s).** Design methods arose from postwar operational research, management science and creativity techniques (e.g., Osborn, Gordon). Archer’s 1965 statement captured the ambition: systematic, computer- and management-inspired problem-solving for design (p. 1). Simon’s *Sciences of the Artificial* (1969) positioned design as potentially scientific.  
2. **Crisis (1970s).** Key pioneers repudiated design methods. Alexander (1971) declared disengagement, criticising irrelevance to practice. Jones (1977) denounced behaviourism and 'fixing life into a logical framework.' Rittel and Webber (1973) reframed design/planning as 'wicked problems,' resisting 'tame' scientific techniques (pp. 1–2).  
3. **Reframing (1980s).** Rittel’s idea of 'generations' of methods salvaged the field, opening the way to second-generation participatory, argumentative methods. Schön’s *Reflective Practitioner* (1983) gave epistemological weight to practice and intuition. Archer (1979) reframed design as possessing its own way of knowing (p. 3).  
4. **Consolidation.** The 1980s saw emergence of dedicated journals (*Design Studies*, *Design Issues*, *Research in Engineering Design*), international conferences (ICED, EDRA, ASME) and growing interest in design cognition (Lawson, Rowe). Cross positioned 'designerly ways of knowing' as the touchstone of the discipline (1982, 2006).  
5. **Maturity (1990s–2000s).** Proliferation of journals, societies and conferences gave design research international legitimacy. The DRS itself matured into a global body, exemplified by its 40th anniversary in Lisbon (2006).  
**Conclusion →** Design research survived its crisis by moving from a scientistic ambition to a discipline grounded in reflective practice, tacit knowledge and plural methodologies.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
- Provides historical validation for the project’s **critical reinterpretation of DDR systematic methods**.  
- Confirms that **linear, scientistic logics broke down** under wicked complexity, requiring pluralistic, participatory approaches.  
- Supports the project’s theoretical framework: **interpretivism + critical theory**.  
- Underscores the importance of **taxonomy**: first- vs second-generation methods reflect classificatory work that naturalised stages in design history.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Confirms Archer’s 1965 view: 'the growing advocacy of systematic methods of problem solving, borrowed from computer techniques and management theory' [@Cross2007FortyYearsDesign, p. 1].  
- Demonstrates 1970s backlash: Alexander’s rejection ('forget the whole thing'), Jones’s critique of logical frameworks (p. 2). Useful for contrasting DDR optimism with contemporaneous disillusionment.  
- Supports reframing briefs and methods as evolving instruments: Rittel’s 'generations' logic legitimises adaptation (pp. 2–3).  
- Provides anchor for Archer’s 1979 shift: 'there exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating… as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods' (p. 3). This directly underpins the project’s interpretivist–critical paradigm.  

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Archival analysis (DDR models in context) → Comparative case (DDR vs 1970s backlash) → Computational modelling (testing 'generations' logic) → Reflective synthesis  
- **Deliverables →** Historical grounding for the taxonomy of methods → Justification of reflexive briefs → Evidence for embedding 'designerly knowing' into practice interventions  
- **Stakeholders →** Design historians → Methodologists → Educators → Policy-makers

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Concise synthesis.** Offers a clear periodisation (1960s optimism → 1970s crisis → 1980s reframing → 1990s consolidation).  
- **Authorial authority.** Cross was a leading participant in the field, giving insider perspective.  
- **Conceptual contribution.** Establishes 'designerly ways of knowing' as a disciplinary core.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Editorial brevity.** At four pages, offers a survey not deep analysis. Limited engagement with non-Western traditions.  
- **Potential bias.** As a key actor, Cross may present a smoother narrative of 'crisis → recovery' than archival complexity warrants.  
- **Empirical thinness.** Lacks detailed project-level case evidence; relies on canonical quotes.  

### Author’s credibility
Nigel Cross is one of the most influential figures in design research (Open University), editor of *Design Studies*, author of *Designerly Ways of Knowing* (1982, 2006). His authority in narrating the field is unmatched.  

### Contextual validity
The historical trajectory generalises broadly across Western design research. However, engineering design’s parallel development in Germany, Japan and the US shows divergent emphases.  

### Comparisons
- Aligns with Buchanan (2019) on fourth-order design (complexity, pluralism).  
- Resonates with Kimbell (2012) on situated, reflexive practice.  
- Complements Boyd Davis & Gristwood (2017), who show Archer’s doctoral thesis enacting this very crisis/revision in microcosm.  

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- Cross’s narrative shows that systematic models (DDR, Archer) were historically necessary but not sufficient. They became heuristics, not universals.  
- Rittel’s 'generations' echoes today’s need for computational simulation: test models under volatility, iterate reflexively.  
- Archer’s 1979 statement validates practice-based epistemologies central to this project.  
- The editorial strengthens the case for treating DDR methods as **contested knowledge**, not as failed relics.  

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- Archer (1965): 'The most fundamental challenge to conventional ideas on design has been the growing advocacy of systematic methods of problem solving, borrowed from computer techniques and management theory' (p. 1).  
- Alexander (1971): 'Forget it, forget the whole thing' (p. 2).  
- Jones (1977): 'I dislike the machine language, the behaviourism, the continual attempt to fix the whole of life into a logical framework' (p. 2).  
- Rittel (1973): 'first generation' vs 'second generation' methods (p. 2).  
- Archer (1979): 'There exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating… as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods' (p. 3).

## Questions for further research
- How do 'generations' of methods map onto today’s computational/AI-enhanced methods?  
- What would a 'third generation' of design methods look like in socio-technical, AI-mediated contexts?  
- How can Archer’s 1979 'designerly knowing' be operationalised in empirical, practice-based projects?  
- Where do non-Western traditions of design methods sit within this 40-year history?
