# Scope of this note
Close reading of Cross’s retrospective history of the 'design methods movement' (1948–1992). This note goes beyond summary to interrogate the **taxonomic operations** (e.g., 'generations'), the **epistemic politics** of science–design distinctions, and the **institutional myth-making** that stabilises a canonical lineage. It is written to explicitly triangulate with the DDR archive, the interpretivist–critical framework, and the project’s integrated spine.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
- To narrate the emergence (1962), crisis (1970s) and revival (1980s) of design methodology.  
- To clarify the contested vocabulary: **scientific design**, **design science**, **science of design**.  
- To assess whether design methodology has matured as an academic field despite practitioner scepticism (stated explicitly in the conclusion) [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, pp. 15, 19–23].

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
- **Design:** Narrative intellectual history/literature synthesis.  
- **Evidence base:** Conference proceedings, landmark books, topical strands e.g., AI in design, VDI engineering models (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure—the Association of German Engineers), editorial trends; no archival triangulation, practitioner ethnography, or formal historiography protocols.  
- **Limits of method:** Reliant on **insider perspective** and secondary synthesis; no explicit criteria for inclusion/exclusion; categories (e.g., 'first/second generation,) are asserted rather than operationally justified [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, pp. 15–18, 22–23].

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Origin story:** 1962 London Conference on Design Methods is canonised as the 'birth'' of modern design methodology; earlier roots acknowledged (Zwicky, 1948) but subordinated to 1962 as the symbolic launch [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, pp. 15–16].  
2. **Crisis of the 1970s:** Founders Alexander and Jones publicly repudiate 'design methods'; Rittel & Webber reframe design/planning problems as **wicked**, not amenable to optimisation techniques [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, pp. 16–17].  
3. **Taxonomic rescue:** Rittel’s **'generations'** schema enables continuity by recoding failure as developmental transition (from optimisation to argumentative/participatory modes) [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, p. 17].  
4. **Divergence by domain:** Architecture/planning move toward argumentative participation; engineering doubles down on systematicity (Hubka, Pahl & Beitz, ICED/VDI) with strong 1980s growth, especially in Europe/Japan [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, pp. 17–18, 22].  
5. **Re-specifying 'science':** Cross distinguishes **scientific design** (modern, science-infused practice), **design science** (systematic approach and knowledge base), and **science of design** (study of design via systematic methods), and cautions against simplistic dichotomies [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, pp. 19–22].  
6. **Field status:** By early 1990s, the field is institutionally mature (journals, conferences) but suffers a **practitioner confidence gap** and limited acknowledged application [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, pp. 18, 23].

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
- **Contextual baseline:** Supplies the canonical storyline that the project interrogates—useful as an **object of critique** rather than a neutral history.  
- **Taxonomic theory:** 'Generations' functions as **classification work** that stabilises a field under pressure—prime material for the project’s taxonomy lens.  
- **Interpretivist–critical framing:** The paper’s technocratic tilt exposes where power, institutions and exclusions shape what counts as 'method', aligning with the project’s critical stance.  
- **DDR triangulation:** Cross foregrounds Archer, systematisation and the science–design debate—topics central to DDR archival analysis and the practice-based intervention strand.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- **Canonical quotes** from Alexander/Jones document the **practitioner revolt** the project seeks to address with reflexive, practice-based testing [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, p. 16].  
- **'Generations'** as a **survival taxonomy** motivates building a **critical taxonomy** for DDR methods that surfaces silences/omissions [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, p. 17].  
- **Divergent models** (argumentative vs. systematic) justify comparative case analysis across archival DDR projects and modern analogues [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, pp. 17–18].  
- **Confidence gap** underscores the need for decision-support prototypes and computational models that are **critically addressable**, not black-boxed [@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology, p. 23].

### Hooks into the project
- **Workstreams →** Archival DDR analysis; critical taxonomy; comparative case mapping; computational modelling and simulation; decision-support prototyping; reflective synthesis.  
- **Deliverables →** (i) Critical taxonomy of DDR/systematic design; (ii) Practice-tested framework for adaptive methods; (iii) Prototype AI 'design decision companion.'  
- **Stakeholders →** Design historians; complex systems and innovation labs; public sector design units; DDR archivists; AI/ML methodologists.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Clear consolidation** of a dispersed literature; maps venues, actors, and strands (AI in design; engineering models; journals).  
- **Terminological clarification** (scientific design/design science/science of design) remains pedagogically useful for structuring debates.  
- **Honest about crisis:** foregrounds founder disavowals and the wicked problems challenge; refuses naïve triumphalism.  
- **Diagnoses divergence:** recognises field-specific evolution rather than assuming a single methodology fits all.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Canonical myth-making:** A linear 'rise–fall–revival' arc **naturalises 1962** as the origin and marginalises parallel genealogies (Scandinavian participatory design, cybernetics/second-order systems, critical design).  
- **Unexamined taxonomy:** Treats **'generations'** as descriptive, not as **political classification** that rescues legitimacy; no reflexive audit of what falls outside the schema.  
- **Technocratic bias:** Overweights engineering and optimisation/logical models; under-reads **embodied, tacit and situated** design knowledge (the very gap Cross elsewhere champions).  
- **Weak practice analytics:** Acknowledges low practitioner uptake but **does not analyse mechanisms of alienation** (e.g., temporal costs, institutional incentives, tacit skill suppression).  
- **Science–design simplifications:** Repeats 1960s oppositions (analytic vs. constructive) even while noting they are outdated; misses richer STS/philosophy of science resources available by 1993.  
- **Positionality:** Written by a movement insider; **field-stabilising narrative** risks circularity (the history justifies the field that the history constructs).

### Author’s credibility
- Nigel Cross (Open University; TU Delft) is among the most cited design-methods scholars; author of *Developments in Design Methodology* (1984) and *Engineering Design Methods* (1989). High credibility, with the standard caveat about insider bias shaping canon formation.

### Contextual validity
- Strong **disciplinary** validity for Anglo-European design methods discourse; limited **global** and **counter-tradition** generalisability. Best treated as a **situated disciplinary narrative**, not a universal history.

### Comparisons
- **Archer (1968):** Cross centres Archer but does not follow through on the **practice breakdowns** later exposed by Boyd Davis & Gristwood (2017).  
- **Buchanan (2019):** Rejects universalist trajectories; emphasises **fourth-order** complexity—problematises generational storytelling.  
- **Bowker & Star (1999):** Show classification as moral-political infrastructure—undercuts the neutrality of 'generations.'  
- **Latour (1987):** Where Cross stabilises results, Latour urges **reopening black boxes**; helpful counter-method for this project.  
- **Gooding (2022)/Jaillant (2022):** Demand **critical addressability** of data/archives—precisely what Cross’s history lacks.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- **Design methods as discourse management:** The paper performs **disciplinary consolidation**—a necessary but partial act. The 'generations' schema is best read as **rhetorical classification** enabling survival, not empirical taxonomy.  
- **Institutional power matters:** Conferences/journals are narrated as milestones; however, they are also **centres of calculation** (Latour) shaping what counts as 'method.'  
- **For DDR:** Treat early systematic models not as failed relics or triumphant templates, but as **heuristic black boxes** to be reopened via practice-based trials, AI-assisted analysis, and reflexive documentation.  
- **For the project’s theory:** Use Cross to **map** the canon; use Latour/Bowker-Star/Horkheimer to **critique** it; use practice-led and computational strands to **re-test** it under contemporary complexity.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- '**I reacted against design methods…** the continual attempt to fix the whole of life into a logical framework.'—Jones (quoted) ([@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology], p. 16).  
- '**Forget the whole thing…** if you call it a *Methodology*, I just don’t want to talk about it.'—Alexander (quoted) ([@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology], p. 16).  
- **Paraphrase:** Rittel’s **'generations'** reframes the 1960s methods as a necessary but simplistic start, legitimising a **second generation** oriented to participatory, argumentative processes ([@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology], p. 17).  
- **Paraphrase:** Engineering design methodology’s 1980s growth (ICED, VDI, Japan/Europe) diverges from architectural models ([@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology], pp. 17–18, 22).  
- **Paraphrase:** The field is academically mature yet lacks practitioner confidence and acknowledged application ([@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology], p. 23).  
- **Paraphrase:** 'Scientific design' vs. 'design science' vs. 'science of design' distinctions are necessary but historically confused; simplistic dichotomies have waned ([@Cross1993HistoryDesignMethodology], pp. 19–22).

## Questions for further research
- **Counter-genealogies:** What histories emerge if 1962 is **de-centred** in favour of Scandinavian participatory design, cybernetics, or non-Anglophone traditions?  
- **Taxonomy audit:** How would a **reflexive, computational taxonomy** (clustering, semantic mapping) reclassify DDR methods beyond the 'generations' schema?  
- **Practice uptake:** What organisational, temporal and tacit-knowledge dynamics drive **acceptance or rejection** of systematic methods in real projects?  
- **Science–design debate:** Can **interpretivist–critical** lenses reconcile or replace the analytic/constructive dichotomy with plural epistemologies fit for socio-technical complexity?  
- **AI/ML today:** Are contemporary AI-assisted workflows a 'third generation,' or do they **invalidate generational framings** by shifting from method recipes to **decision ecologies**?
