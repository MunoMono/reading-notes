# Scope of this note
This review concentrates on **Chapter 2 (Theory and Methodology)** and **Chapter 3 (Epistemology)** of Fallan’s *Design History: Understanding Theory and Method* (2010). Expanded to provide deeper analysis, integration with the doctoral research spine, and an evidence pack for direct quotation.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
- **Chapter 2 Theory and Methodology.** Seeks to show how design history can evolve from narrow stylistic or object-centred narratives by integrating theoretical and methodological resources from art history, anthropology, material culture and science and technology studies (STS). Fallan introduces **'domesticating domestication'** as a conceptual tool for tracing how design ideologies are translated across multiple sites of practice, including **manufacturing as a second site of domestication**. This directly connects to the project’s aim of reconciling systematic design methods with socio-technical complexity.  
- **Chapter 3 Epistemology.** Establishes what counts as valid knowledge in design history. Fallan treats canonical categories such as **modern/modernity/modernism** as historically contingent, reframes **isms** as **ideologies rather than theories** and develops a pluralist, reflexive epistemology. This aligns with the project’s interpretivist–critical framework, which emphasises situated meaning-making and interrogation of systemic power.

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
- **Chapter 2.** A historiographic synthesis that reviews the field’s reliance on borrowing from other disciplines. Advocates **methodological pluralism**, and proposes domestication as an analytical framework bridging ideology and practice (production ↔ consumption). This informs the project’s cross-case comparative matrix within the methods spine.  
- **Chapter 3.** A conceptual and epistemological inquiry. Draws on sociology, cultural theory and philosophy of science (Bourdieu, Foucault, Derrida, Kuhn, Feyerabend, Masterman) to articulate layered knowledge regimes. Provides analytical tools for the project’s **critical taxonomy of methods**. No sample size, the reasoning is discursive.

## Key findings and arguments
### Chapter 2 – Theory and Methodology
1. **Borrowing as constitutive.** Design history thrives through **appropriating adjacent frameworks**. Such borrowing augments its toolkit rather than diluting its identity. This supports the project’s **secondary contribution** of methodological synthesis.  
2. **'Domesticating domestication.'** Extends the domestication concept to show how **ideologies of design are negotiated and transformed in practice**. Manufacturing is reframed as a **second site of domestication**, not just a technical execution phase. This is crucial for DDR archival work on how briefs and methods mutated under real project pressures.  
3. **Bridging production and consumption.** Calls for methods that follow design ideas across **professional discourse, manufacturing, mediation and use**. This resonates with the project’s integrated **archival–practice–simulation spine**, where ideas are traced from historical documentation into contemporary live testing.  
4. **Plural, reflexive method suite.** Advocates an **expanded repertoire**—case study, comparative, ethnographic, discourse analysis—suitable for interrogating both historical and contemporary design knowledge. This echoes the project’s interpretivist commitment to methodological pluralism.

### Chapter 3 – Epistemology
1. **Terminological reflexivity.** Because terms like 'modern/modernity/modernism' are ubiquitous yet unstable, epistemology must interrogate their **historicity, relationality and contestation**. This underlines the project’s theoretical need to treat DDR categories (e.g., 'systematic design') as historically contingent constructs.  
2. **Isms as ideologies, not theories.** Isms are **dogmatic, programmatic and normative**, prescribing what design *ought* to be. This echoes the project’s insistence on testing DDR’s systematic models as *heuristic probes*, not universal truths.  
3. **System–practice dialectic.** Isms evolve through negotiation between ideology and practice. This maps onto DDR’s hospital bed project, where Archer’s prescriptive model collapsed into negotiated stakeholder dynamics.  
4. **Against myth and black boxes.** Critiques mythic narratives and canonical black-boxing, insisting on reopening cases and exposing silences. This supports the project’s **critical taxonomy**.  
5. **From revolutions to plural paradigms.** Reinterprets Kuhn through Feyerabend and Masterman: instead of a single paradigm, design history shows **multi-paradigmatic coexistence**. Introduces three levels: **metaphysical (worldviews), sociological (institutions/movements), artefact (exemplars/models)**. This provides a model for situating DDR projects at multiple levels simultaneously, strengthening the project’s comparative analysis strand.  
6. **Validity through plausibility and reflexivity.** Argues that validity rests not on universal laws but on **argumentative plausibility, triangulation, coherence and reflexivity**. This directly underpins the project’s reliance on action research, comparative triangulation and reflective synthesis.

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
- **Interpretivist–critical orientation.** Fallan explicitly warns against taking concepts such as modern, modernity, modernism or isms as given. Instead, they must be treated as contingent, contested, and historically embedded—what Bourdieu and Wacquant call 'reflexive sociology' (pp. 107–109). This rejection of naïve empiricism confirms that knowledge is interpretive and value-laden, mirroring the project’s interpretivist–critical stance.  
- **Handling incomplete archives.** The argument that isms are constructed, negotiated, mediated, consolidated and decomposed (pp. 108–109) underlines the need for reflexive category work. Fallan stresses that validity comes from coherence and plausibility rather than exhaustive evidence, which directly supports DDR archival work with partial, biased, or silent records.  
- **Taxonomic critique.** Fallan calls for a fundamental critique of classification and categorisation, showing how isms and categories risk myth-making, black-boxing, and becoming 'obstacles to any rewarding comprehension of history' (pp. 107, 124–127). This aligns closely with the project’s strand on critical taxonomies.  
- **Bridging ideology and practice.** Chapter 2 introduces 'domesticating domestication', extending the concept from household media use to how design ideologies are negotiated across multiple sites. He identifies manufacturing as a second site of domestication where ideas undergo transformation (pp. 104–105). This resonates with the project’s ambition to test DDR methods in live practice contexts where ideology collides with constraints.  
- **Paradigm pluralism.** In reassessing Kuhn, Feyerabend and Masterman, Fallan argues that design history exhibits multi-paradigmatic states. He distinguishes metaphysical paradigms (worldviews/epistemes), sociological paradigms (institutions/movements), and artefact paradigms (exemplars) (pp. 134–137). This three-tier schema provides a framework for comparative analysis in DDR research without collapsing complexity into linear succession.

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Provides an **analytic bridge (domestication)** for tracing ideas into manufacturing and stakeholder negotiation.  
- Justifies the **epistemic reflexivity** required for DDR’s incomplete and biased archives.  
- Endorses **triangulated plausibility** as a validity criterion for combining archival, computational and practice-based data.  
- Supplies a **taxonomy-friendly critique** of canonisation and classification.  
- Equips the **comparative strand** with a three-level paradigm mapping, avoiding false unities.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Conceptual clarity.** Reframing isms as ideologies foregrounds their normative power.  
- **Dynamic historicism.** Emphasises negotiation, contestation and translation.  
- **Plural paradigms.** Provides a practical schema (metaphysical, sociological, artefact).  
- **Direct resonance with project.** Offers methodological and epistemological cover for triangulation, taxonomic critique, and practice-based testing.

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Operationalisation gap.** Suggests domestication and pluralism but without worked protocols.  
- **Eurocentrism.** Non-Western and decolonial perspectives remain underdeveloped.  
- **Underplays digital/computational.** Little engagement with ML/AI or data science, central to the project.

### Author’s credibility
Kjetil Fallan is a leading design historian, recognised for work on Scandinavian design and historiography. His authority strengthens the book’s methodological prescriptions.

### Contextual validity
The pluralist and reflexive positions remain current and are reinforced by later STS and design anthropology. Still, global and computational perspectives are missing.

### Comparisons
- Bowker & Star on classification as political.  
- Latour on black-boxing.  
- Buchanan (2019) on fourth order design complexity.  
- Cross on the maturation of design methods.  
- Feyerabend on methodological proliferation.

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- Chapters 2 and 3 offer a blueprint for **integrated methodological pluralism and epistemic reflexivity**. For the project, this translates into practical justification for a hybrid archive-to-practice spine.  
- Reframing isms as ideologies situates DDR systematic models as **heuristic ideologies**—to be critiqued, adapted, and re-tested, not discarded.  
- Multi-level paradigms allow DDR projects to be mapped simultaneously across worldviews, institutions and artefacts, aligning with the project’s comparative and taxonomic strands.

### Implications for practice, policy or theory
- **Practice.** Operationalise domestication to track how design ideologies mutate under organisational constraints.  
- **Policy.** Encourage archives to document classification and canonisation practices reflexively.  
- **Theory.** Legitimate plausibility and reflexivity as criteria for valid design knowledge production.

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- 'Design history has a long tradition of appropriating theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches from other disciplines … Proposing yet another source of inspiration … adds to the theoretical resources and methodological repertoire' → Chapter 2, Theory and Methodology (p. 104).  
- 'Various types of design communities domesticate ideologies … The manufacturing industry can be said to represent a second site of domestication' → Chapter 2, Theory and Methodology (p. 104).  
- 'Terms like ‘modern’, ‘modernity’ and ‘modernism’ are omnipresent … [yet] display complexity and ambiguity' → Chapter 3, Epistemology (p. 109).  
- 'Isms are not theories … rather … ideologies … dogmatic, evangelistic, and programmatic' → Chapter 3, Epistemology (pp. 115–116).  
- 'Isms are highly dynamic configurations; they change according to time and space' → Chapter 3, Epistemology (p. 119).  
- 'Periodization in terms of revolutionary breaks has long been a standard tool … Yet design often exhibits coexisting paradigms' → Chapter 3, Epistemology (p. 132).  
- **Paraphrase:** Fallan emphasises that the validity of design-historical knowledge is not grounded in universal laws but in the plausibility and coherence of arguments, supported by reflexive awareness of categories and contexts (Ch. 3, pp. 137–138).  
  - **OCR context (pp. ~137–138):** *'… design history does not operate with universal laws of cause and effect … it has to rely on argumentative plausibility and coherence … reflexivity about the categories employed is crucial to avoid reifying myths or black boxes …'*
