## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
Gilliland and McKemmish aim to map the **past, present and future** of archival and recordkeeping research, tracing how the field has diversified beyond bureaucratic traditions into what they call the **archival multiverse**. Their guiding questions are:  
- How has archival research evolved from narrow institutional practice to a pluralist, global field?  
- Which paradigms and methods now underpin archival research, especially in digital and community contexts?  
- How should archival scholarship develop to address societal grand challenges such as human rights, justice and sustainability?

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
The chapter is a **synthesising review** rather than an empirical study. The authors combine:  
- **Historical analysis** of archival discourse (1980s–2010s).  
- **Comparative mapping** of thematic shifts (Table 4.1 contrasting Couture & Ducharme 2005, Gilliland & McKemmish 2004, McKemmish 2016).  
- **Meta-analysis** of major projects (e.g., InterPARES, Clever Recordkeeping Metadata, Trust & Technology, AERI).  
- **Philosophical framing** in positivism, interpretivism and critical theory, extended by postmodern and postcolonial critiques.  
- **Methodological survey** covering action research, grounded theory, participatory approaches, ethnography, diplomatics, metadata modelling and literary warrant analysis.  

No statistical sample is involved; instead, the ‘data’ are the research programmes, methods, and theories that define the field.

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **From archive to multiverse.** Archival science has shifted from a single bureaucratic paradigm to a **pluralist multiverse**, engaging Indigenous, community, diasporic and activist contexts (pp. 85–87).  
2. **Diversification of themes.** Research now spans digital curation, participatory archives, gender and sexuality, rights in records, big data, social justice and critical archival studies (pp. 88–91).  
3. **Collaborative expansion.** The field has moved from individual scholars to global, multi-disciplinary partnerships, bridging academia, practice and communities (pp. 91–92).  
4. **Theory-building.** The archival turn (Foucault, Derrida, Appadurai) inspired new theory: continuum models, critical archiving, postcustodial approaches (pp. 92–94).  
5. **Infrastructures.** The emergence of AERI, targeted funding (NHPRC, ARC, EU Horizon 2020), and doctoral education has consolidated a **research infrastructure** (pp. 93–96).  
6. **Paradigmatic plurality.** Research spans positivism (digital preservation standards), interpretivism (ethnographies of archival practice), and critical theory (decolonising the archive) (pp. 96–98).  
7. **Double hermeneutics.** Archival research studies both the archive and the society that produces it, blurring boundaries between subject and object (p. 98).  
8. **Toolkit of methods.** Tables 4.2–4.4 document a **mature and diverse methods spine**, from participatory action research to metadata mapping and visualisation (pp. 99–114).  
9. **Reflexivity.** Researchers are urged to practise reflexive transparency, especially in participatory and Indigenous contexts (pp. 112–114).  
10. **Future orientation.** The field must align with societal grand challenges (climate change, social justice, human rights) and maintain inclusive, ethical research practices (pp. 114–115).  

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
- Provides a **meta-map of methods** directly supporting the project’s research-methods spine.  
- Confirms the necessity of **critical taxonomy**: archival methods are classificatory artefacts that naturalise worldviews.  
- Aligns with the **interpretivist–critical framework**: positivist residues coexist with reflexive, critical approaches.  
- Validates the project’s **statements of intent**: archival science faces the same tension between systematisation and reflexive practice as design research.  

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- Establishes archival science as a **meta-field** that cuts across domains, resonating with design research as trans-disciplinary [@Gilliland2018ArchivalRecordkeepingResearch, p. 86].  
- Demonstrates the **archival multiverse** as an analogue to design’s wicked, pluralistic contexts (p. 87).  
- Provides **methodological warrant** for participatory, reflexive approaches, mirroring the project’s co-design strands (pp. 100–103).  
- Codifies tools for handling **incomplete and contested data**: grounded theory, ethnography, reflexivity (pp. 100–114).  
- Anchors critical archival studies as evidence that **classification is ideological**, not neutral (pp. 92–94).  

### Hooks into the project

- **Deliverables →** Taxonomic framework → Participatory workshop protocols → Incomplete-data schema → Ethical research guidelines  
- **Stakeholders →** Archivists → Community partners → Human-rights NGOs → Design researchers → Data/AI teams

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Breadth and synthesis.** Brings together decades of research into a coherent map.  
- **Methodological richness.** Comprehensive toolkit spanning social science, humanities, computing.  
- **Ethical reflexivity.** Strong emphasis on community-centred, inclusive approaches.  
- **Theoretical innovation.** Links archival theory to postmodern, postcolonial and critical frames.  

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Survey, not analysis.** Dense mapping but little critical interrogation of contradictions between paradigms.  
- **Western tilt.** Heavy reliance on Anglo-European and Australasian sources; global South under-represented.  
- **Technological optimism.** Digital infrastructures presented as largely beneficial; less attention to failures or exclusions.  

### Author’s credibility
Gilliland (UCLA) and McKemmish (Monash) are leading figures: editors of *Research in the Archival Multiverse* (2016), pioneers of the continuum model, with long-standing international authority.  

### Contextual validity
Findings generalise: the archival multiverse concept applies to AI/ML data taxonomies, participatory design, and community archives worldwide. However, contexts with weak infrastructure may not fit the same research pathways.  

### Comparisons
- Aligns with Bowker & Star (1999): classifications are political infrastructures.  
- Resonates with Freire (2014): dialogical praxis in community archives mirrors problem-posing pedagogy.  
- Extends Archer (1968): taxonomies of objectives/constraints are mirrored by archival metadata schema.  
- Complements Cross (2007): traces maturation of archival research in parallel to design research.  

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- Archival research demonstrates that **methods are never neutral**: they embed worldviews, exclusions and values.  
- The archival multiverse is a productive parallel to **design multiverses**, justifying pluralist, reflexive taxonomies.  
- Reflexivity and participatory action research provide a bridge between systematic modelling (Archer) and dialogical praxis (Freire).  
- Implication: our project’s taxonomy must itself be **reflexive, contestable and community-validated**, not fixed.  

## Evidence to quote or paraphrase
- 'From a world constructed in terms of “the one” and “the other” to a world of multiple ways of knowing and practicing' (p. 87).  
- 'Archival science has emerged as a meta-field that cuts across content disciplines' (p. 86).  
- 'In emergent archival and recordkeeping research, liberation may well require the counter-intuitive application of what appear to be the opposites of interpretive and positivist approaches' (p. 98).  
- **Paraphrase (resonance with Bowker & Star):** the ethos that 'the only good classification is a living classification' (Bowker & Star 1999, p. 326) is echoed in Gilliland & McKemmish’s call for reflexive, adaptive taxonomies.

## Questions for further research
- How can archival methodologies be adapted to AI/ML contexts without reproducing exclusion?  
- What mechanisms ensure that reflexive taxonomies remain open and 'living'?  
- How can participatory archiving be scaled in resource-poor or authoritarian contexts?  
- How should archival research align with climate change and sustainability agendas?  
- What safeguards are needed to prevent co-option of critical archival practices by institutions of power?
