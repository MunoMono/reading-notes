# Scope of this note
This note concentrates on the book’s core claim that classification is infrastructural work with political and ethical consequences, and on its analytic vocabulary (boundary infrastructures, residual categories, torque/trajectory, texture, membership/naturalisation). It is read against a PhD concerned with epistemic drift as it becomes materially recorded, structured, and obscured in institutional infrastructures, and with the possibilities for reconstruction through computational methods.

## Purpose and aim
### What research question or objective is being addressed?
The book asks how classification systems operate as working infrastructures—simultaneously material and symbolic—and how their seemingly technical decisions produce durable consequences for knowledge, organisations, and lived experience. It aims to make the “inner space” of infrastructure analytically visible, arguing that classifications are not neutral descriptions but politically and ethically charged technologies embedded in practice, standards, and bureaucracy (p. 319–321).

A second aim is normative: it argues for treating classification as a site of political and ethical work, including the need to retain ambiguity, trace construction histories, and design for heterogeneity rather than chasing a chimera of universal unity (p. 313–315).

## Methodology
### Describe the research design, methods and sample size.
This is a synthetic, multi-case, socio-technical study combining historical analysis, document-based reconstruction of standards, and qualitative fieldwork. It uses extended case studies of “working classification systems” maintained by organisations and states—disease classifications (ICD), tuberculosis, race classification under apartheid, and the classification of nursing work—and uses these to build an analytic vocabulary for infrastructure (p. 322–323).

The book also reports interviews with practitioners (including public-health officials, nurses, and scientists) to show how local work-arounds, compromises, and “invisible work” are constitutive of classification practice, not deviations from it (p. 320–321). Its logic is comparative and abductive: it moves between cases to general claims about standardisation, residual categories, and the distribution of suffering across infrastructures (p. 315–317).

## Key findings and arguments
### Summarise the main results and conclusions
1. **Classification is not explanation; it is infrastructural attachment with real effects.** A label does not explain behaviour, but it enrols people and things into infrastructures—work practices, narratives, organisational routines—through which consequences are enacted (p. 319]. Classification is therefore a political and ethical technology embedded in “working infrastructures” and rendered powerful partly through invisibility (p. 319–320).

2. **No classification is unambiguous or purely technical; political positions and organisational tensions are inside the scheme.** The book rejects a fantasy of uniform, neutral classification: formal and informal, prototypical and rule-based (“Aristotelian”) categorisation are routinely conflated; technical choices systematically reflect contested positions and constraints, and outcomes cannot be predicted by politics alone because classifications are also exploratory tools in practice (p. 323).

3. **Infrastructure is a “built moral environment”; residual categories and invisibility organise exclusion and suffering.** The entanglement of everyday categories with formal standards means moral and political decisions become layered into technological structures and are removed from public participation; “other” categories are constitutive, not peripheral, and their distribution is an ethical question (p. 320, p. 326). The book argues for an “ethics of ambiguity” in the face of globalising representation systems (p. 313).

## Relevance
### How does it link to the research questions or framework?
For a project focused on epistemic drift and its material recording, the book provides a theory of *why* drift becomes hard to see: classifications “disappear into infrastructure” and become taken for granted, while still shaping moral and scientific choices (p. 320). It also provides mechanisms for *how* drift becomes materially structured: (i) through standards and interoperable categories that accumulate inertia; (ii) through residual categories that silently pattern what counts; and (iii) through local work-arounds that stabilise the system while hiding its contingency (p. 320–322, p. 326).

It is therefore directly aligned to a strand concerned with where epistemic drift is materially recorded, structured, and obscured, and it also constrains any computational reconstruction strand by insisting that visibility is political, and that classifications are active creators of categories rather than passive mirrors (p. 321–322).

## What the authors bring to the table
### Key contributions and claims
- **A re-description of classification as infrastructural practice.** Classification is framed as organisational and informational work embedded in practice, rather than as a representational afterthought (p. 320–321).
- **An analytic vocabulary for socio-technical critique and design.** Concepts such as boundary infrastructures, filiations (threads tying categories to people), texture, trajectory/torque, and residual categories enable analysis of how classifications bind, enable, constrain, and distribute suffering (p. 314–317, p. 324, p. 326).
- **A design-facing ethical agenda.** The book argues that one can intervene in infrastructure “not only [as] critics but also as designers”, and that classification systems should retain traces of construction and remain “living” rather than ossified (p. 319, p. 326–327).
- **A critique of universalism in information systems.** It rejects both unitary universal schemes and romanticised boundary-object pluralism, insisting that heterogeneity involves concessions, negotiation, and power (p. 313–315).

### How the PhD project responds to this evidence
- **Building on:** The project can take the book’s vocabulary as a method for reading institutional records as infrastructures (not merely sources), treating metadata schemas, filing systems, and model taxonomies as “built moral environments” with residual categories that must be surfaced (p. 326). The book’s insistence that classification is embedded in practice also supports practice-led research that studies classification *in use* rather than as a static artefact (p. 320–321).
- **Challenging:** The project can test whether computational approaches (multimodal ML and visual analytics) can be made compatible with an “ethics of ambiguity”, rather than becoming a new engine of forced naturalisation and irreversible filiation (branding) (p. 313, p. 317).
- **Informing practice:** It reframes design choices around schemas, datasets, labelling, and archival description as ethical decisions about visibility, reversibility, and who controls ambiguity—practical questions for research instruments and for institutional stakeholders (p. 316–317).

## Positioning this work
### What this literature will do for the project
- **It provides a spine-level justification for treating classification as an ethical-political medium, not a technical footnote.** The argument that infrastructure’s invisibility strengthens “rule by no one” and excludes publics from policy participation supports a critical stance toward institutional record systems and their governance (p. 326).
- **It supplies transferable analytic units for studying epistemic drift materially.** “Texture” (enabling/constraining patterns across systems) and “trajectory/torque” (how biographies and categories twist one another) provide a way to narrate drift not as mere semantic change but as infrastructure-mediated life chances and knowledge regimes (p. 324).
- **It legitimises design intervention as scholarship.** The move from critique to design (“not only critics but also designers”) aligns with a practice-led programme that builds instruments, prototypes, or workflows for more reflexive classification and archival description (p. 319).

### What this literature will not do
- **It will not supply a single operational method or metric for “better” classification.** The book offers design sensibilities and an analytic vocabulary, but it resists prescriptive universal rules and does not resolve how to formalise ambiguity in computational systems without loss (p. 323–324).
- **It will not eliminate the need for situated fieldwork.** Its own argument depends on long-term, detailed ethnographic and historical study of systems in use; it implies that desk-based schema critique alone will miss the local work that makes infrastructures function (p. 323–324).
- **It leaves open how to govern trade-offs.** The book acknowledges black boxes are necessary and “not necessarily evil”, but it does not fully specify governance mechanisms for deciding when opacity is acceptable and when it becomes domination (p. 320).

## Project integration
### Why it helps the project (evidence-linked)
- It grounds the project’s claim that epistemic drift becomes hard to detect because categories become “interwoven” with infrastructure and habit, shaping moral and scientific choices while appearing natural (p. 320).
- It provides a direct warning that classification is often misread as explanation; the project’s reconstructions must avoid treating labels, tags, and model outputs as epistemic closure rather than infrastructural attachment (p. 319).
- It supports a methodological commitment to study drift as *organisational and informational practice*, including work-arounds and local compromises, not only as conceptual history (p. 320–321).
- It offers evaluative criteria for classification ethics: attention to residual categories (“who gets to determine what is ‘other’”), retrievability/visibility, and the inertia produced by infrastructural embedding (p. 326).
- It legitimises design-oriented outputs: boundary infrastructures enable intervention that respects heterogeneity while remaining workable across communities, a useful model for tools that bridge archives, research, and computation (p. 313–315).

### Hooks into the project

  - Strand 2 (material recording/archives/infrastructure): classification as “built moral environment”, residual categories, invisibility, and archaeology of standards (p. 320, p. 326).  
  - Strand 3 (computational reconstruction): risks of franchised standardisation and surveillance; need to model cooperation across heterogeneous worlds and keep open spaces for change (p. 321–322).

  - An analytic rubric for auditing classification systems in archives/datasets (visibility, residual categories, reversibility, control of ambiguity).  
  - A methods chapter framing classification as infrastructure-mediated epistemic drift, with design implications.

## Critical evaluation
### Strengths
- **Conceptual power with empirical grounding.** The argument that classification is infrastructural and embedded in practice is supported by concrete cases and by attention to work-arounds and “invisible work” (p. 320–321).
- **Ethical clarity without naïve transparency politics.** The claim that “visibility is not an unmitigated good” avoids simplistic calls for openness and links visibility to participation, inertia, and control (p. 326).
- **A design-relevant vocabulary.** Boundary infrastructures and filiations are practically usable for diagnosing how systems connect heterogeneous communities and how categories attach to people (including reversibility and control) (p. 314–317).
- **Transferability across domains.** Although the cases are specific, the framing—classification as a moral-informatic architecture—generalises to contemporary computational infrastructures (datasets, ontologies, model taxonomies) without requiring anachronistic translation (p. 324).

### Weaknesses and limitations
- **Operationalisation gap.** The book’s virtue—refusal of reductive prescriptions—creates a practical challenge for designers and researchers seeking implementable procedures for “ethics of ambiguity” in formal systems (p. 313).
- **Case selection and scope.** The emphasis on classification systems in medicine, public health, race bureaucracy, and nursing may underplay domains where classifications are intentionally ephemeral or playful; the framework may risk over-extending infrastructure metaphors to all categorisation.
- **Ambiguity about intervention points.** The claim that no one controls infrastructure sits uneasily with the insistence on design intervention; a stronger account of governance, accountability, and institutional levers would reduce this tension (p. 320).
- **Potential rhetorical density.** The reliance on metaphor (threads, texture, underwear) is defended as necessary, but it can obscure analytical boundaries for readers seeking formal definitions and testable propositions (p. 323–324).

### Author’s credibility
Both authors are established scholars in science and technology studies and information studies, and the work is supported by a long-running research programme (including an NSF-funded “Classification Project”) and collaboration with domain experts (notably in nursing classification) (p. ix). This institutional embedding strengthens the book’s empirical access and its plausibility as an account of working infrastructures.

### Contextual validity
The book’s claims are strongest where classification systems are standardised, bureaucratically embedded, and connected to consequential decision-making (health, state categorisation, professional accounting). Generalisation to lighter-weight or explicitly provisional taxonomies should be treated cautiously; however, its core mechanism—embedding produces invisibility and inertia—remains applicable wherever categories are routinised in tools and organisations (p. 319–320).

### Comparisons
- **With design-methods canon (Archer; Cross; Schön):** Where design-methods texts tend to frame method as a deliberate procedure, this book frames “method” as what infrastructure already does—often invisibly—through categories, standards, and forms. It therefore shifts attention from choosing methods to auditing the classificatory consequences of methods-in-use (p. 320–321).
- **With wicked-problem accounts (Rittel & Webber):** It complements wickedness by showing how institutions stabilise complexity through classification, often by pushing heterogeneity into residual categories and by making politics disappear into forms (p. 320, p. 326).
- **With politics-of-artefacts traditions (Winner; Suchman):** The book explicitly aligns classification with the question of whether artefacts and categories have politics and develops this at the level of standards and infrastructures (p. 327).

## Interpretation
### Analysis and insights
- **Classification as drift engine, not drift recorder.** The book suggests that infrastructures do not merely *record* epistemic drift; they actively *produce* it by naturalising certain distinctions and making alternatives hard to articulate or retrieve. Drift is therefore partly an artefact of standardisation pathways and their inertia (p. 319–320).
- **Residual categories as analytical diagnostics.** The insistence that “other” categories are constitutive reframes archival absences and dataset “unknown/other” labels as central evidence of moral and organisational order, not noise. This is a direct methodological handle for institutional critique (p. 326).
- **Boundary infrastructures as a design model for plural institutions.** The book’s realism about concessions (for example, professional groups adapting their representations to fit hospital systems) anticipates contemporary trade-offs when heterogeneous communities must share platforms and models (p. 314).
- **Torque and trajectory as a bridge between macro-infrastructure and micro-biography.** The claim that individual trajectories are “twisted and torqued” by classifications offers a narrative device for linking epistemic drift to lived consequences—an important move for research that must remain ethically accountable (p. 324).

### Critical thinking and rigour
The book’s rigour lies in its triangulation across history, ethnography, and comparative case analysis, and in its refusal of both technical determinism and purely discursive critique. It argues that deconstruction alone is insufficient and proposes a structured way to “scale up” from local practices to social infrastructures via boundary infrastructures (p. 319). Its argumentation is conceptually dense but methodologically explicit about the need for long-term empirical study of systems in use as a design aid (p. 323–324).

- **Paraphrase:** Working infrastructures embed moral and political choices by making categories invisible and taken for granted; the ethical problem intensifies when the powerful’s categories become default, and when policy is layered into inaccessible technological structures. (p. 320–321) (p. 320–321)  
- **Paraphrase:** Residual categories are not peripheral: analysing who and what is pushed into “other” reveals organisational structure and the distribution of suffering, and becomes a key design criterion. (p. 326) (p. 326)

## Questions for further research
- How can an “ethics of ambiguity” be operationalised in computational classification (datasets, ontologies, model taxonomies) without collapsing into either unusable openness or coercive standardisation? (p. 313–315)  
- What would it mean, in institutional archives, to design “living classifications” that retain traces of construction and support revision while preserving accountability and comparability? (p. 326–327)  
- Which methodological techniques best surface residual categories and their “texture” in contemporary infrastructures (including machine-learning pipelines), and how can this be made legible to non-expert stakeholders? (p. 326)  
- Under what governance conditions does increased retrievability/visibility expand participation, and when does it intensify surveillance and “rule by no one”? (p. 326)  
- How can a study of epistemic drift avoid treating classification outputs as explanations, while still producing actionable design interventions in complex organisations? (p. 319–321)
