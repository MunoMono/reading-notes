# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** Schwartz & Cook give a canonical argument that archives are *active power sites* (not neutral stores), which lets me treat DDR description, selection, and access as “testamentary” traces of institutional epistemic shift. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 13–15, 18]``  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** S2 backbone: shift becomes observable where institutions decide what to record, what to keep, how to describe, and how to mediate access—these are the places where the archive materially shapes what can be known. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 5–6, 13–15]``  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** This is useful because it names *specific archival interventions* (record-keeping design, appraisal, description, preservation, access/communication) as the mechanism of power, rather than treating “the archive” as only a metaphor. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 14–15]``  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will use Schwartz & Cook only when I can (1) point to a DDR decision-trace (selection/description/access architecture) and (2) show how that trace privileges some stories and marginalizes others (power made legible). ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 14–15, 18]``  

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Schwartz & Cook write as guest editors introducing a themed issue on “archives, records, and power.” Their intervention is aimed at dismantling the professional myth of neutrality/objectivity and insisting archives be understood as social institutions that actively shape memory and identity through continual intervention. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2]``  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Their key move for my project: stop treating archival arrangement/description as passive “after the fact” work; treat it as a present-tense apparatus that produces knowledge conditions (and thus produces shift). ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 15, 18]``  

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to make archival power visible by arguing that archives are socially constructed institutions where record-keeping design, appraisal, description, preservation, and access continually reshape memory and identity, and therefore must be debated and made accountable. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 14–15, 19]``  

## Lit review wiring (for copy/paste)
- **Lit review role:** Canonical S2 anchor: archives as active sites where power is exercised through record-making/keeping, selection, description, and access.
- **1 sentence to paste into lit review:** Schwartz and Cook argue that archives are not passive repositories but active sites where power is negotiated: through record-keeping systems, appraisal/selection, description/preservation, and mediated access, archivists continuously reshape what counts as evidence, memory, and identity. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 14–15]``  

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Archives are not neutral repositories; they are created by the powerful and actively control which stories become memory.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** The abstract and opening argue that archives were historically treated as neutral “repositories of facts,” while in reality archives are “established by the powerful,” privilege some stories, marginalize others, and represent “enormous power over memory and identity.” ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, p. 1]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If archives are built to serve power, then the archive’s structure is itself evidence: what exists and what is absent are produced outcomes, not accidents.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** I treat DDR archival structure as a “testament” of epistemic shift: power is legible in what gets stabilized as record, category, and access path.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR: example where “official” description privileges an institutional narrative over practitioner/marginal voices—collection-level + series-level language)

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** Archivists exert power through specific interventions: record-keeping system design, appraisal/selection, description, preservation, and patterns of communication/use.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** They state archivists “continually reshape, reinterpret, and reinvent the archive” through record-keeping design, appraisal/selection, description/preservation, and communication/use patterns. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, p. 1]`` The argument is expanded: power recognized can be questioned and made accountable. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 2, 6]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** These interventions are exactly where shift becomes observable because they encode criteria, value, and meaning into the archive’s material form.
- **So what for my thesis:** To “activate” DDR, I need to expose those intervention points as inspectable seams (selection logs, description rules, access architecture), not just interpret content items.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR: identify one intervention chain end-to-end—what was selected, how described, what access constraints applied; link to IDs + any policy docs)

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** The myth of neutrality and objectivity is dangerous because it hides intervention, naturalizes “order,” and privileges mainstream power—especially in description and access.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** They warn that denial/overlooking of power is “misleading… and dangerous,” and that scholars often treat presented records as unproblematic while archivists underestimate their “large footprints.” ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 2, 6]`` They detail how description, access filters, and professional terms (“evidence,” “authenticity,” “control”) can mask power and reinforce neutrality myths. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 14–15, 18]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If neutrality is a professional self-image, then “objective” description is not neutral; it is a mechanism that can conceal value judgments and exclusions.
- **So what for my thesis:** DDR activation must surface the archive’s mediation layers (metadata choices, ordering logic, access filters) as part of the evidence of shift.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR: a description template / controlled vocabulary / access tier rule that forces convergence, flattening ambiguity or conflict in the record)

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Archives as social constructs:** archives originate in rulers’/institutions’ information needs and social values; they shape frameworks of remembering. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 3–4]``  
- **Power (in archives):** power to record, name/label/order, preserve, describe, and mediate access—shaping memory and identity. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 5, 13–15]``  
- **Situated knowledge / partial perspective (objectivity):** “objectivity” reframed as situated knowledge and “power-sensitive conversation” (applied to archives). ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 9–12]``  
- **Mediation layers:** creator + archivist interventions add layers of meaning that become naturalized and unquestioned. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, p. 18]``  

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A precise list of *where* to look for shift in an institution: selection/appraisal, description, preservation, access architecture, and communication/use. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1, 14–15]``  
  - A justification for treating archival metadata and ordering as evidence, not just packaging. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 3–4, 14–15]``  
  - A mandate: make power transparent so it can be debated and held accountable. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 2, 19]``  
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will treat “activation” as exposing mediation layers (what was done to the record) alongside the record itself—so DDR users can read with awareness of intervention. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 6, 18]``  
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - Which DDR interventions are currently invisible (selection criteria, description rules, access filters), and what minimal disclosures would make them inspectable without collapsing usability? ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 14–15, 19]``  

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** S2 lit review section on archives as power sites; justify why “testaments” include finding aids, classification, description language, access constraints, and appraisal traces. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 14–15, 18]``  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** Joan M. Schwartz and Terry Cook, “Archives, Records, and Power: The Making of Modern Memory” (2002). Then Schwartz and Cook (2002).
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO (DDR: pick one collection/series; record its description fields + ordering logic + access conditions as “testament”)
- **Workstreams →** S2 (primary); bridges to S1 (genealogy of neutrality myth) and S3 (making mediation layers legible computationally)
- **Deliverables →** “Mediation map” checklist for DDR (selection → description → access), with fields that must be recorded as evidence
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archivists/records managers; archive users; RCA governance (accountability/ethics)

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** This is a framing/introduction that powerfully names the problem and loci of intervention, but it does not by itself provide DDR-specific operational measures—you must supply DDR traces and show them in use. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 1–2, 19]``  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I cite “archives are power” without demonstrating a concrete mediation layer in DDR (a selection decision, a description rule, an access filter), it becomes rhetoric rather than evidence. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 14–15, 18]``

- **Short note form:** Schwartz and Cook, “Archives, Records, and Power,” 1–2.
- **One quote worth lifting (≤2 lines):** TODO (pick a ≤2-line quote once you’ve decided which claim you’re using in the chapter; keep page exact).  
- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** Schwartz and Cook argue that archival neutrality is a professional myth: archives and archivists continually shape memory through selection, description, preservation, and mediated access, so power must be made visible for debate and accountability.

# Related works (only if it directly connects)
- They cite Foucault/Derrida archive debates and “situated knowledge” (Haraway) as context for rethinking archival objectivity. ``[@Schwartz2002ArchivesRecordsPower, pp. 4, 12]``  

# Follow-ups (next actions, not vibes)
- What I will read next: One applied S2 piece on description/classification ethics (to move from framing into mechanisms and case material).
- What I will test or write next: Take one DDR item/series and write a “mediation chain”: (a) what was recorded, (b) what was selected out, (c) how it is described, (d) how access is mediated; treat that chain as the “testament” of shift. TODO
