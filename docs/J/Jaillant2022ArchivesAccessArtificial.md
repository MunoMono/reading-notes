**RQ (supervisor verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**RQ (working):** How might testamentary traces of epistemic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCA’s DDR archive?  
**Model title:** How epistemic shift becomes observable across design methods, institutional archives, and multimodal computational reconstruction  
**Primary strand:** S3 — How epistemic shift can be reconstructed and made legible through multimodal ML and visual analytics  

**Seams to watch (optional, pick 1):**
- Where conceptual shift becomes infrastructural shift
- How shift is materialised and distorted in institutional record-keeping
- How computational methods expose or amplify epistemic shift

# Constraints (anti-bloat / anti-hallucination)
- No page cite → write TODO (needs page)
- Max 3 claims: Claim → Evidence → Warrant → So-what
- Each claim must include a practice cross-check (or TODO)
- No antithesis lists: write Boundary + Risk
- If it doesn’t serve the RQ/model: OUT OF SCOPE (why)
(Full rules: project/constraints.md)

# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):**  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):**  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):**  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):**  

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Who is the author / what tradition / what institutional or disciplinary positioning? What problem-space are they in *at that time*?  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):**

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to ___ by ___ in order to ___.

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):**
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** ``[@Jaillant2022ArchivesAccessArtificial, p. X]``
- **Warrant (my words):** why the evidence supports the claim
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):**
- **Practice cross-check:** where my material supports/complicates this (pointer to practice note / archive ID)

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):**
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** ``[@Jaillant2022ArchivesAccessArtificial, p. X]``
- **Warrant (my words):**
- **So what for my thesis:**
- **Practice cross-check:**

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):**
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** ``[@Jaillant2022ArchivesAccessArtificial, p. X]``
- **Warrant (my words):**
- **So what for my thesis:**
- **Practice cross-check:**

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Term:** how I will use it (in my words) + page if defined

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):**
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):**
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):**
- **Workstreams →**
- **Deliverables →**
- **Stakeholders →**

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** where it stops being useful for *my* project
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** what confusion it could cause in my writing

# Methods spine tags (tick what it actually touches)
- [ ] Framing and theory
- [ ] Study design
- [ ] Data collection and instruments
- [ ] Analysis and models
- [ ] Synthesis and interpretation
- [ ] Reporting and communications

# Chicago NB payload (capture what you’ll need later)

- **First full note (write it out here):**  
- **Short note form:**
