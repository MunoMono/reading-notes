# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** Jones gives a canonical account of how “new methods” reorganise the design process (and why strategy choice matters), which helps me name shift as a shift in *process structure + criteria*, not just vocabulary. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 46, 64, 76]``  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Methods genealogy: shift becomes visible when design moves from (1) “mysterious creativity” vs “rational procedure” debates to (2) explicit staging (divergence/transformation/convergence) and (3) meta-choice of strategies/methods. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 46, 64, 76–81]``  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** Jones is useful because he doesn’t just list methods; he links methods to *models of the designer* (black box / glass box) and to *strategy selection* (pre-planned vs adaptive). ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 46, 76]``  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will use Jones only when I can (1) point to an explicit process shift (stage structure or strategy choice) and (2) tie it to a DDR “testament” (record of changing criteria, categories, or decision trails). ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 64, 76–81]``  

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Jones is writing in a period where design method is being formalised and systematised, and he is trying to make the “new methods” intelligible as part of a developing design process rather than as disconnected techniques. He frames design as an activity that can be described via different epistemic models (creative, rational, control), and he treats methods as tools whose fit depends on the problem situation. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 46, 76]``  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Jones assumes “methods” can be selected and applied with a degree of transparency. In institutional archives, the selection logic is often implicit and later appears only through traces (classification choices, documentation structures, omissions). ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 76–81]``  

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to make the “new methods” coherent by showing that design is expanding into a staged, strategy-dependent process (divergence → transformation → convergence), and by proposing that method choice should be based on problem fit rather than method fashion. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 64, 76–81]``  

## Lit review wiring (for copy/paste)
- **Lit review role:** Canonical framing for “shift” as changes in process structure (stages) and meta-procedures (strategy selection), not only changes in claims about creativity or rationality.
- **1 sentence to paste into lit review:** Jones frames design methods as part of a developing process: competing models of the designer (black box vs glass box) give way to staged activity (divergence/transformation/convergence) and, crucially, to choosing strategies and methods based on fit to problem conditions rather than assuming one universal procedure. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 46, 64, 76–81]``  

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Design methods sit on different models of what a designer is (mystery, rational process, or control system), and those models shape what counts as a “good” method.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Jones sets out three viewpoints and symbolises them as a cybernetic picture: the designer as a “black box” (creative leap), a “glass box” (explicable rational process), and a “control” viewpoint. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 46]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If method is justified by a model of the designer, then shifts in model imply shifts in what counts as legitimate evidence, rigour, and procedure.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** I use Jones to show epistemic shift as a shift in the underlying model of designing (and therefore a shift in criteria for methods and documentation).  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR trace where “intuition/creative leap” is later rewritten as “rational procedure” or “managed process” via description/standardisation)

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** The design process is better described as staged activity—divergence, transformation, convergence—rather than as one stable linear procedure.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Jones names three stages—divergence, transformation, convergence—and uses them as loose categories for discussing design theory and methods. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 64]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If the process is staged, then “testaments” of shift can be located as traces of stage emphasis and stage transitions (what gets expanded, compressed, or omitted).
- **So what for my thesis:** This gives me a concrete scaffold for reading DDR records: where is divergence (expansion of possibilities) recorded, where is transformation recorded, and where is convergence enforced?  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR record chain showing expansion/reframing, then a transformation step, then a narrowing decision expressed through classification or access rules)

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** Strategy choice matters: pre-planned strategies work for familiar situations but are poor fits for novel design; method selection should follow inputs/outputs and situation constraints.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Jones states that “pre-planned strategies… are rigidly fixed in advance just like computer programs” and are “more suited to familiar than to novel situations.” ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 76]`` He then sets out a selection procedure: “Select… methods of generating the required outputs from the available inputs” using a grid/matrix. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 81]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If strategies are situation-bound, then the archive can be read as evidence of which situations were assumed (familiar vs novel) and which outputs were privileged (what the institution wanted to produce).
- **So what for my thesis:** Jones lets me argue that DDR activation should expose the *assumed strategy* and *preferred outputs* embedded in institutional description and access workflows (a locus of epistemic shift).  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (DDR example: a description workflow that forces pre-planned categories onto novel material, producing distortions/omissions)

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Black box / glass box:** Competing models of designing (mysterious creative leap vs explicable rational process). ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 46]``  
- **Divergence / transformation / convergence:** Three named stages used to describe how design activity expands, reframes, and narrows. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 64]``  
- **Pre-planned strategy:** Fixed-in-advance procedure suited to familiar/modification work rather than novel invention. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 76]``  
- **Inputs/outputs method selection:** Choose methods by matching available inputs to required outputs (matrix logic). ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 81]``  

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - shift can be operationalised as a shift in the *model of designing* (black box → glass box → control) and the criteria those models justify. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 46]``  
  - shift can be evidenced in *process structure*: which stages are made visible, and which are suppressed or forced. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 64]``  
  - “Choosing strategies” is a concrete place to look for institutional assumptions (familiar vs novel; preferred outputs). ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 76–81]``  
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will treat archival description/classification as a kind of strategy choice: it constrains what inputs are accepted and what outputs the archive produces (finding aids, categories, access conditions). ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 76–81]``  
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What are the DDR archive’s “required outputs” (institutional deliverables), and how do they force convergence too early (before sufficient divergence/transformation is documented)? ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 64, 81]``  

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Methods/lit review: justify shift as shifts in design-process structure and strategy selection (not only discourse), and connect to archival workflows as process constraints. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 46, 64, 76–81]``  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention: John Jones, *Design Methods* (1992). Then Jones (1992).
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO (DDR workflow instance where classification/description acts as convergence mechanism)
- **Workstreams →** S1 methods genealogy; S2 (bridge) institutional process constraints; S3 (optional) computational surfacing of stage/criteria shift
- **Deliverables →** A shift rubric keyed to (a) model of designing, (b) stage structure, (c) strategy assumptions (inputs/outputs)
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archive users; institutional stewards; examiners

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** Jones gives a strong canonical scaffold for thinking about method/process, but he does not give me DDR-specific indicators unless I supply archive traces and demonstrate how strategy/stage assumptions are inscribed in records. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, pp. 64, 76–81]``  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I cite “divergence/transformation/convergence” without showing concrete DDR traces of stage transitions, I turn a process model into a slogan and my shift claim becomes untestable. ``[@Jones1992DesignMethods, p. 64]``
