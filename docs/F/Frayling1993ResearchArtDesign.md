# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** To stabilise what “research” means in art/design education so I can treat archival traces as evidence rather than vibes.  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Methods / epistemic shift background — gives a historically specific taxonomy that shows how “research” in art/design was re-legitimated and operationalised in institutions like the RCA.  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** “Testament” risks being read as expressive autobiography; Frayling helps separate “reference material” and “embodied thinking” from communicable research outputs.  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** (1) Does the paper give *operational distinctions* I can apply to DDR archive records? (2) Does it tie legitimacy/definitions to institutions and documentation practices?

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Christopher Frayling writing as RCA (institutional voice) during early-1990s UK higher education funding/assessment pressures. The problem-space is not “what artists do”, but how the academy and funders decide what *counts* as research in art/craft/design, and what forms of evidence + communication are required.  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** “Research = science stereotype” is treated as the default measuring-stick; Frayling shows this is historically contingent and politically produced, not neutral.

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to stabilise what “research” can mean in art and design by unpacking stereotypes and proposing a three-part taxonomy (into / through / for) in order to make the debate practically usable for institutions and degrees.

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Page refs use the printed pagination visible in the PDF: printed p.1 corresponds to PDF p.4, etc.

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Confusion about “research” in art/design comes from stereotypes and shifting institutional usage, not from a single definitional problem.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Frayling contrasts “little r” research as careful searching for something defined in advance, with “big R” research as professionalised R&D tied to innovation and institutions; he then says the current debate in art/craft/design has revolved around stereotypes and even “blind alleys” like whether an exhibition “counts”. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, p. 1]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If “research” shifts between everyday searching, professionalised R&D, and funding-driven institutional usage, then disputes about “what counts” are predictable: people are arguing from different models and incentives.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** In the DDR archive, “research” cannot be treated as a stable label; I need to read it as a contested institutional category whose meaning shifts with funding, degree structures, and documentation norms. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, p. 1]``
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — identify DDR records where “research” is asserted without specifying object, method, or communicable form (e.g., programme docs, validation paperwork).

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** What counts as research is a legitimation problem (who is “master” of meaning), not only a methodological one.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Using Humpty Dumpty, Frayling asks “which is to be master?” and reframes the issue as legitimation: peer group, institution, funding structures, “invisible College”, society; he flags that the question is political (degrees/status) *and* conceptual (bases of practice). ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, p. 2]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If legitimacy sources determine meaning, then any “epistemic shift” worth tracking will show up as changes in who authorises research and what forms of output are validated.
- **So what for my thesis:** “Testamentary traces” of epistemiv shift in the DDR archive should be sought in validation, assessment, and documentation regimes—not only in studio artefacts—because those regimes are where legitimacy is enacted. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, p. 2]``
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — map DDR “legitimation surfaces”: committee minutes, policy updates, assessment rubrics, degree regulations, funding language.

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** The useful operational distinction is three kinds of research in art/design—*into*, *through*, and *for*—and the hinge is communicable documentation, not the artefact alone.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Frayling proposes: research *into* art/design (historical, perceptual, theoretical; aligned with thesis/dissertation models); research *through* art/design (materials research, development work, action research with diary + contextual report); and the “thorny” research *for* art/design where thinking is embodied in artefact and communication may be visual/iconic—raising status concerns and need for differentiation. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, pp. 4–5]``
- **Warrant (my words):** The taxonomy converts a vague debate into a set of degree/record forms. It also defines an evidence condition: “results” must be communicated, and documentation (diary/report) distinguishes research from reference-gathering.
- **So what for my thesis:** To activate the DDR archive, I can treat each record as belonging to (or crossing) “into/through/for” and then audit what documentation exists (or is missing) to make the research legible as evidence of drift. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, pp. 4–5]``
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — pick 10 DDR items and tag them into/through/for + note what documentation exists (report/diary/metadata/exhibition text) and what is absent.

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Research (little r / big R):** little r = careful search for something defined in advance; big R = professionalised R&D tied to innovation, institutions, and modern usage. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, p. 1]``
- **Legitimation (“which is to be master?”):** meaning is governed by authority sources (peer group/institution/funders), not just by semantics. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, p. 2]``
- **Research into / through / for:** operational taxonomy for art/design research with distinct output and documentation expectations. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, pp. 4–5]``

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A usable classification that can be turned into DDR metadata tags and audit questions (into/through/for). ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, pp. 4–5]``
  - A clean lever for “testament”: documentation that communicates results (diary/report/validated outputs) is the trace that makes practice evidential. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, p. 5]``
  - A historically situated account of how “research” becomes an institutional resource problem (legitimation). ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, p. 2]``
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - Use “testament” as *documented communicability* (what can be shown/told and by what authorised form), rather than as expressive autobiography.
  - Treat “epistemiv shift” as shifts in *authorisation + documentation regimes* as much as shifts in method vocabulary.
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - In DDR, what stable documentary forms correspond to “research through” (diary/report) and how often are they missing?
  - Where do institutional legitimacy moments sit in the archive (policy updates, rubric changes, degree regulations), and can they be sequenced as drift?

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Literature review / methods genealogy section where I justify why “research” must be read as a contested institutional category in art/design education.
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** “In *Research in Art and Design* (1993/4), Christopher Frayling…” then shift to “Frayling argues…” thereafter.
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO — DDR activation pilot: create an “into/through/for” filter and test retrieval quality against a set of known items.
- **Workstreams →** S1 canon + definitions; S2 (later) documentary regimes; S3 (later) computational tagging of “into/through/for”.
- **Deliverables →** (1) DDR taxonomy tagging schema; (2) audit checklist for documentation adequacy; (3) literature review paragraph on legitimation.
- **Stakeholders →** RCA research office / programme leads; DDR archive staff; examiners (criteria clarity).

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** Frayling gives an institutional taxonomy, not a full epistemology of knowledge production; it won’t by itself explain *how* drift happens inside methods, only how it is framed/validated.  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I treat “into/through/for” as fixed categories rather than negotiated legitimacy outcomes, I’ll reintroduce the very “counting” debate he warns against (and miss drift at the seams).

- **Short note form:**  
  Frayling, “Research in Art and Design,” p. __.
- **One quote worth lifting (≤2 lines):** TODO (pick ≤2 lines) (p. __)
- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** Frayling’s hinge: what separates research from reference-gathering is communicating results via recognised documentary forms (e.g., diary/report), not the artefact alone. ``[@Frayling1993ResearchArtDesign, pp. 4–5]``

# Related works (only if it directly connects)

# Follow-ups (next actions, not vibes)
- What I will read next:
  - Herbert Read source Frayling cites (to trace provenance of the three-part distinction).
  - Kenneth Agnew (1993) on documentation gaps as epistemic risk (bridges S1→S2).
- What I will test or write next:
  - Build a DDR “into/through/for” tagging trial on 10 items + record what documentary forms exist/miss; write a 200–300 word methods rationale using Frayling as the anchor citation.
