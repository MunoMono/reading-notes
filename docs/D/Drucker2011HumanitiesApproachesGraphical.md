# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** To stop treating visualisation as neutral “output” and use it as a designed, interpretative method for making testamentary traces legible (including uncertainty and absence).  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Methods / S3: my reconstruction and visual analytics must show interpretative commitments, not pretend to be observer-independent truth.  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** “Capta” names the constructedness of what I call “data”, and gives me a permission structure to visualise uncertainty, selection, and point of view without apologising. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 1, 3]``  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will only use visualisations that (a) expose the choices that produced the capta, and (b) render ambiguity/uncertainty rather than hiding it behind clean metrics. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 1, 4]``  

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Johanna Drucker writes from digital humanities and book/history-of-knowledge traditions (UCLA Information Studies), addressing a moment when DH adopts tools from the natural and social sciences (GIS, charts, “information visualisation”) as default practice. She argues these tools import realist assumptions that collapse interpretation into “what is” and asks DH to design graphical methods that are explicitly interpretative. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 1]``  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Visual analytics and ML dashboards still often treat categories, metrics, and axes as self-evident; Drucker gives me language to mark those as constructed and contestable in DDR activation. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 1, 4]``  

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to reframe “data visualisation” as a humanities problem by redefining data as *capta* and proposing graphical forms that embody interpretation in order to resist observer-independent claims of certainty. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 1, 3]``  

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Standard visualisation tools smuggle realist, observer-independent assumptions into DH and make interpretation look like fact.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** She calls common visual tools an “intellectual Trojan horse” whose scientific rhetoric “conceals their epistemological biases”; they pass as “unquestioned representations of ‘what is’.” ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 1]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If the display looks like a neutral mirror, the reader stops asking what was selected, excluded, parameterised, or interpreted.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** DDR activation cannot treat visual outputs as neutral evidence; I must show the interpretative framework that produced them.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — pick one DDR prototype visual (timeline/map/network) and list the “hidden” assumptions (category definitions, inclusion rules, missingness).

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** “Data” should be treated as *capta* (taken/constructed), and graphical display should reveal the interpretative work that produced it.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** In the abstract and early argument she insists “all data have to be understood as capta, taken and constructed,” not “given.” ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 1]``  
  She states that “no ‘data’ pre-exist their parameterization” and that graphical clarity hides the interpretative framework that brought the numbers into being. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 3–4]``
- **Warrant (my words):** Parameterisation is where shift happens: definitions, categories, and thresholds shift over time and across institutions, but charts hide that labour.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** “Testament” in DDR should include the trace of how records became capta (selection rules, description standards, omissions), and the display should make that trace visible.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — identify one DDR metadata field whose definition has shifted across time/collections (a definitional shift trace).

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** Humanistic visualisation must be designed to show ambiguity, uncertainty, affect, and multiple viewpoints, not only stable metrics.
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Her bar chart example shows how charts naturalise contested categories (nation, gender, “present time”) and argues that changing the representation requires changing the premises of construction. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 4]``  
  She defines “subjective” as interpretative construction (point of view, agenda, co-dependent observer/phenomena) and proposes displays that register affect and instability, not just quantities. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 8]``  
  Her Snow example demonstrates how alternative mappings could express lived experience and emotional landscape as part of interpretation. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 20–21]``
- **Warrant (my words):** If the goal is to make shift legible, the graphics must be able to show degrees, ranges, uncertainty, and competing readings.
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** My S3 outputs should include “uncertainty-first” graphics (confidence, missingness, contested categories) as a method, not as a caveat in text.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO — decide one visual variable that will always encode uncertainty/missingness in DDR outputs (and label it explicitly).

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Capta:** information “taken and constructed”, not “given”; produced through parameterisation and interpretation. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 1, 3–4]``  
- **Subjective (as used here):** shorthand for interpretative construction and point of view; not mere idiosyncrasy. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 8]``  
- **Temporality:** time as a factor of X (variable, discontinuous, multi-directional) rather than a neutral container. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 10]``  

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - A clear design principle: visualisation is a knowledge claim, so it must expose its interpretative construction. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 1, 3]``
  - A practical diagnostic: when a chart looks “self-evident”, it is probably concealing assumptions (categories, axes, units). ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 4]``
  - A route to “testament”: treat the evidentiary trace as including how the record became capta (and how its parameters shift). ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 3–4]``
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will treat DDR visual outputs as *interpretative interfaces* with explicit labels for premises, uncertainty, and missingness. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 8, 21]``
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What are the minimal graphic conventions I can standardise for DDR so that every chart/map/network shows its interpretative commitments and uncertainty without becoming unreadable? ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, p. 10]``  

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Methods chapter: justification for “capta + interpretative display” as the ground rule for S3 reconstruction and visual analytics. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 1, 3–4]``  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention: “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” (Drucker, 2011).  
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO — one DDR case where a visualisation would mislead unless I show category shift (archive ID / note link).  
- **Workstreams →** S3 (visual analytics + ML) feeding back into S2 (how description standards create capta)  
- **Deliverables →** DDR “capta card” for every visual: parameterisation, missingness, contested categories, confidence  
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archivists (description choices); technical build (visual design system); users (interpretation and trust)

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** This is a conceptual and design argument about representation, not a full technical specification for ML or graph pipelines.  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I cite “capta” as licence for vagueness, I could weaken evidentiary discipline; the point is to make construction explicit, not to evade accountability. ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 3–4]``

- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** She argues that common charts and maps naturalise categories and metrics, hiding the interpretative work that produced them, so DH needs graphics designed to express interpretation, ambiguity, and point of view (pp. 1, 3–4, 8). ``[@Drucker2011HumanitiesApproachesGraphical, pp. 1, 3–4, 8]``
