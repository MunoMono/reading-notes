# Thesis job (do this first)
**Project research question(s) this serves (paste verbatim):** how might a testament epistemetic shift be used as an approach to activate the RCAs DDR archive?  
**Why I’m reading this now (1 sentence):** To anchor “epistemic shift/drift” in a concrete, historical account of how design makes claims through objects, not only through text.  
**Where it sits in my argument (chapter/section + what it helps me say):** Methods / canon groundwork (S1): design knowledge is argued and stabilised through artefacts that “declare” values, which can be treated as testaments in an archive.  
**Why this term, not alternatives (1–2 lines):** “Rhetoric of things” names persuasion through artefacts, not only interpretation of words. It helps me describe how shifts become legible in material form, which “communication” or “semiotics” alone cannot cover.  
**My benchmark for using it (1–2 criteria I will apply):** I will only use Buchanan when I can point to (1) a specific artefact or record and (2) the value/attitude it asserts, with page-cited support.

# Position + moment (2–4 lines)
Buchanan writes in mid-1980s design-theory debates, pushing design beyond “styling” or technical problem-solving towards persuasion and public meaning. He positions rhetoric (not semiotics) as the better frame for how designers invent, justify, and stabilise ideas in culture.  
**Canon assumptions to problematise / update for 2026 (1–2 lines):** Treat this as a canon text, but bring it forward by asking who is authorised as “audience” and whose values get treated as shared when artefacts “declare” themselves.

# The author’s main move (1 sentence)
They try to explain how design persuades by treating products as rhetorical demonstrations in order to show design as an architectonic, value-shaping practice.

# Three-claim evidence ledger (max 3 claims)
> Keep claims plain. Always attach page numbers when you can. If unsure: TODO (needs page).

## Claim 1
- **Claim (plain):** Designed objects persuade mainly in the present, by “declaring” themselves as valuable and fit for use.  
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Buchanan aligns “design arguments and the rhetoric of things” with epideictic (demonstrative) rhetoric, where objects exist “primarily in the present as declarations”, and quotes Rosenberg: “Art does not exist. It declares itself.” ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 19]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If design persuasion is epideictic, then its evidence is not only propositions but artefacts that ask for recognition now; the artefact’s existence carries the argument.  
- **So what for my thesis (a reusable sentence):** In the DDR archive, artefacts and records can be treated as “testaments” because they declare values and ways of knowing in the present, not just describe them.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (add one DDR item where the record/artefact asserts “fit for use” or an institutional value).

## Claim 2
- **Claim (plain):** Design operates as an “architectonic art” that organises production, but rhetoric is an architectonic art that guides design thought for an audience.  
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Buchanan argues “design is what all forms of production for use have in common” and calls rhetoric “architectonic with respect to thought… whether in words, things, or actions.” ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 21]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If rhetoric guides how design thought is formed for audiences, then shifts in design knowledge show up as shifts in what counts as persuasive (values, reasons, and demonstrations), not only as shifts in method labels.  
- **So what for my thesis:** Epistemic shift can be tracked historically as changes in how designers justify decisions to audiences (what reasons, what demonstrations, what “commonsense” values).  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (identify one DDR decision trail: brief → minutes → prototype, showing what counts as a “good reason”).

## Claim 3
- **Claim (plain):** Designers “amplify” ideas through things; product culture can be read as a pluralistic field of competing ideas, not a single deterministic logic.  
- **Evidence (quote/paraphrase + page):** Buchanan says designers “are providing an amplification of ideas through man-made things” and suggests reading “the apparent confusion of our product culture” as “a pluralistic expression of diverse and often conflicting ideas.” ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 22]``  
- **Warrant (my words):** If artefacts amplify ideas, then archives become a map of competing epistemic claims; the “shift” is observable in what gets amplified, repeated, and institutionalised over time.  
- **So what for my thesis:** The DDR archive can be activated by treating its holdings as a set of amplified claims (not neutral documentation), and then tracing which claims become authoritative.  
- **Practice cross-check:** TODO (pick one repeated “idea” in DDR holdings and list its traces across formats: memo, catalogue entry, photo, object).

# Definitions / terms this changes (only the ones that matter)
- **Epideictic / demonstrative rhetoric:** persuasion oriented to the present, shaping attitudes of value (praise/blame) rather than proving past facts or choosing future policy. ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 19]``  
- **Rhetoric of things:** designed objects as arguments that “declare” values through their existence and use-context. ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 19]``  
- **Architectonic art:** an organising art that rationalises and coordinates other practices; Buchanan treats design as architectonic for production, and rhetoric as architectonic for thought presented to audiences. ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 21]``  
- **Amplification (as used here):** elaborating the lived environment by making ideas concrete in artefacts, not only expanding language. ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 22]``  

# My response (no antithesis; state positives)
- **What I take from this (1–3 bullets):**
  - Treat artefacts as arguments with audiences, not as “outputs” that merely illustrate a method. ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 19]``
  - Use “architectonic” to describe how design orders practice and institutions, which helps connect to archival structuring later. ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 21]``
  - Use “amplification” as a bridge term: the archive stores amplified ideas, so shift becomes trackable across holdings. ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 22]``
- **What I reframe / adjust (1–2 bullets, stated positively):**
  - I will frame “testament” as an artefact’s declared values + its institutional handling (description, classification, reuse), rather than as a metaphor.  
- **What question it raises next (1–2 bullets):**
  - What counts as “recognition by the current communion of the knowing” in an institutional archive: who is the audience, and who gets excluded? ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 19]``  

# Integration hooks (make it actionable)
- **Where I will cite it (exact paragraph/job):** Literature review section defining how design knowledge travels through artefacts (bridge from “methods texts” to “records and power”).  
- **Where I will name the title in running text (first-use rule):** First mention in chapter: Richard Buchanan, “Declaration by Design: Rhetoric, Argument, and Demonstration in Design Practice” (then shorten to Buchanan, “Declaration by Design”).  
- **Link to my practice evidence (one concrete cross-reference):** TODO (DDR artefact that “declares” a value or method claim; add archive ID).  
- **Workstreams →** S1 canon groundwork → S2 archival structuring → S3 computational legibility (later).  
- **Deliverables →** Definitions page for “testament” + a one-paragraph method note on “artefact-as-argument”.  
- **Stakeholders →** DDR archivists / curators; thesis readers who need a plain definition of how artefacts “count” as evidence.

# Boundary + risk (short, practical)
- **Boundary (1 sentence):** Buchanan helps me define artefacts as arguments; he does not by himself explain how institutional description and classification mediate those arguments.  
- **Risk if misused (1 sentence):** If I treat “rhetoric” as vibe-talk without page-cited claims and concrete artefacts, the thesis will drift into abstraction.

- **Short note form:** Buchanan, “Declaration by Design,” 21.  
- **One quote worth lifting (≤2 lines):** “Art does not exist. It declares itself.” (p. 19) ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 19]``  
- **One paraphrase worth keeping:** Design is an architectonic art for production, but rhetoric is architectonic for thought presented to audiences in words, things, and actions. (p. 21) ``[@Buchanan1985DeclarationDesignRhetoric, p. 21]``  

# Related works (only if it directly connects)
- TODO: Cross1982DesignerlyWaysKnowing (designerly knowledge claims)  
- TODO: Rittel1973DilemmasGeneralTheory (argumentation in wicked problems)  

# Follow-ups (next actions, not vibes)
- What I will read next: Pair Buchanan with an archives/power text to move from “artefact as argument” to “record as institutionalised argument” (e.g., Schwartz and Cook).  
- What I will test or write next: Write a 150–200 word bridge paragraph: “testament” = declared values (Buchanan) + institutional handling (archival standards) + later computational legibility.

## Constraints check
- Missing page cites: None in the three claims; practice cross-checks are TODO (need archive IDs).  
- Drift from RQ/strand: On-strand (S1). All claims support “testament” as observable, material evidence of shift/drift.  
- Bloat: Keep the “Position + moment” section to four lines when drafting the chapter; do not expand “Related works” beyond direct links.
